Six Chinese Missing After Ship Collision

Six Chinese fishermen are missing and two were rescued following a collision between their fishing vessel and a Korean bulk carrier in international waters Monday morning.

According to the Jeju Coast Guard, the fishing boat, Lujiao Yu, capsized after colliding with an 16,000-ton bulk ship, Panbless, owned by Pumyang Shipping, 175 kilometers southwest of Mara Island, south of Jeju Island.

The Korean vessel was so huge that sailors aboard were unaware of the collision with the small boat, according to the coast guard. They later noticed the overturned boat, and rescued two crewmembers who were clinging to the vessel. Another six members, however, are missing.

The Chinese boat was from Qingdao, and the Korean carrier was heading to Vietnam from Russia. The coast guard dispatched two patrol ships for rescue operation.

The cause of the collision is being investigated.

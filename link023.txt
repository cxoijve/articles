  The U.S. Navy has recovered the bodies of seven sailors from inside the USS Fitzgerald, the destroyer that collided with a container ship early Saturday in Japanese waters.
  The bodies were found in berthing compartments that had flooded after the collision.
The commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet says investigations will conducted into how the accident occurred.
He would not characterize what type of collision it was, but did say that the Fitzgerald was "hit on the side" by the container ship, which was far bigger.
The destroyer sustained heavy damage above and below the waterline,  while the container ship sustained only "light" damage and no injury to its crew.

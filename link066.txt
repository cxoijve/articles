At least six workers were killed and 22 others were injured Monday after a tower crane collided with another giant crane, sending broken iron structures falling down to an offshore plant under construction at the dock of Samsung Heavy Industries.

The collision was reported in the Samsung shipyard on Koje Island off the southern port city of Busan. Firefighters said three workers were in serious condition at nearby hospitals while 19 others suffered minor injuries.

Samsung Heavy, one of South Korea's three largest shipbuilders, said an 800-ton giant crane collided with a tower crane when dozens of workers were in the dock.

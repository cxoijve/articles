Meanwhile, Russia and the U.S. are blaming each other for a near collision of their warships.
The U.S. Navy says it happened in the Philippine Sea; other reports say it was in the South China Sea.
  The U.S. says the Russian destroyer Admiral Vinogradov   made an unsafe maneuver,  coming within 30 meters the USS Chancellorsville  , which the U.S. says was moving in a straight line.
Russia's Pacific Fleet, however, says the opposite is true -- that the Chancellorsville came within 50 meters of its destroyer, forcing it to perform an emergency maneuver to avoid collision.

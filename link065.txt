The U.S. Navy on Monday identified the seven sailors who died when their destroyer, the USS Fitzgerald, collided with a container ship in Japanese waters early Saturday.
The sailors were aged between 19 and 37, and their bodies were found in berthing compartments.  
The U.S. Navy said the victims may have been killed by the impact of the collision or drowned in the flooding. 
The commander of the 7th Fleet, Joseph Aucoin, said most of the ship's sailors were asleep when the incident happened.
 The 9-thousand-ton destroyer suffered severe damage above and below the waterline while the 29-thousand ton container ship, ACX Crystal, sustained only "slight damage."
There were no injuries among the 20 Filipino crew members on board the container ship. 
 Multiple investigations by the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Japanese authorities  are looking into how a vessel as big as the container ship could ram into the smaller warship in clear weather.
Other investigations could come from authorities in the Philippines, where the container ship was registered.
 Marine traffic records suggest that the container ship made a sudden U-turn roughly 25 minutes before the crash. 
It is not known why it changed course.

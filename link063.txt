US Navy Orders Operational Pause After Latest Collision

The U.S. Navy has ordered a worldwide "operational pause" of its fleet after a destroyer collided with an oil tanker Monday near Singapore, leaving 10 sailors missing.

The collision involving the USS John S McCain was the fourth crash involving a Navy ship this year and the second in two months.

Admiral John Richardson said he ordered the operational pause in view of a "trend" that demands more forceful action.

After a crash last month, also involving a U.S. destroyer, the commanding officer and several others were dismissed.

We urge marine and fishermen to conduct safety inspections of ships and facilities from time to time when a meteorological warning is released."Meanwhile, the 4th typhoon 'AERE' is a name submitted by the United States, meaning a storm.Due to the high pressure in the northern part of the West Sea, the high pressure of Airy and the North Pacific Ocean is expected to bring in hot and humid air, and the heatwave with strong sunlight is expected to continue until the 6th.

ANTARCTICA RESCUE SHIP SPARTA. Crew members of Russian ship ''Sparta'' which has been trapped for more than a week, are seen as South Korean icebreaker ''Araon'' (not pictured), approaches the Russian ship at 74:57 degrees south latitude and 159:16 west longitude in the Antarctic 25 December 2011. The icebreaker left New Zealand's second-largest city of Christchurch on 17 December to rescue the Russian ship with a crew of 30, which has stranded due to its collision with an iceberg that left its hull with a rip measuring about 150 centimeters. The 7,487-ton Araon carrying a 37-member survey team was on route to Terra Nova Bay in the Ross Sea region of the frozen continent, where South Korea plans to start the construction of the nation's second scientific research base by December next year. The team is expected to return home late January 2012, after conducting research for the establishment of the Jangbogo Scientific Research Base.

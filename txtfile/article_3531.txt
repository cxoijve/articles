Test Platform Completed for Self-navigation, Remote ControlA Samsung Heavy Industries engineer at the company’s Shipbuilding and Maritime Research Institute monitors the surroundings of the Geoje Shipyard through high-performance cameras loaded on Easy Go, an autonomously navigating model vessel.Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) has successfully tested its 5G-based autonomous and remote control navigation system.SHI and SK Telecom (SKT) announced on Dec.10 that they have completed the development of an autonomous and remote control navigation test platform, which connects Daejeon and Geoje through high-speed 5G network, and verified the platform using a test ship in the sea. SHI said that it operated the test ship in the sea from a remote control center located some 250 kilometers away from its Geoje shipyard on Dec 9. The test has met the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).SHI verified two technologies -- autonomous navigation and remote control. The autonomous navigation technology enables a vessel to search for the optimal route and navigate to the destination on its own, avoiding maritime obstacles.The model ship Easy Go, created by SHI in the shape of a LNG carrier, is a 3.3-meter-long self-navigating ship equipped with the company’s auto-pilot and inertial navigation system.Easy Go features high-speed broadband communications functions, high-performance cameras and a LIDAR remote sensing system, and an electric propulsion system equipped with a cloud-based IoT platform. All these devices enable it to navigate autonomously and allow its remote control. Furthermore, five high-performance cameras equipped in the ship allows the remote control center to check its surrounding images and the location of obstacles and to control the ship in real time.Jung Min-heecontact@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

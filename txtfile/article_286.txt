The Yeosu Maritime Police Station announced on the 7th that it will implement special measures for marine safety management during the Chuseok holiday so that returning visitors from the island region can spend a safe holiday ahead of Chuseok.According to the Coast Guard, during the Chuseok holiday over the past three years, the number of passengers on multi-use ships has been decreasing every year, but the number of passenger ships and pilot ships increased by 174% and 33% compared to normal times due to the concentration of returning visitors from islands.This year, according to the social distancing stage (stage 4 in the metropolitan area, stage 3 to 4 in the non-metropolitan area) due to COVID-19, the number of returning passengers using passenger ships and ferry lines is expected to decrease slightly.During the Chuseok holiday, the Yeosu Coast Guard is conducting various on-site inspections, publicity and guidance activities, such as safety management of multi-use ships and crackdown on crimes against people's livelihood.In addition, intensive inspections will be conducted on ship safety facilities and the implementation of COVID-19 quarantine rules centered on wireline and ferry docks in Yeosu-si and Goheung-gun areas.In addition, in order to strengthen the emergency response posture for maritime disasters, it plans to intensively deploy multi-use vessels using patrol vessels and strengthen preemptive maritime accident prevention activities in areas prone to accidents.An official from the Yeosu Coast Guard said, "We will strengthen emergency response posture by establishing a marine accident situation management system by strengthening on-site inspections and safety management in preparation for the increase in the number of multi-use ships during the Chuseok holiday."

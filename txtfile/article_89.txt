Yeosu Coast Guard, receive free inspection of water leisure equipment...On the 16th, Yeosu Ungcheon Yi Sun-shin Marina, two professional repair companies participated for free inspection of motorboats and water motorcycles. Reporter Lee Hak-cheo. Yeosu Marine Police Station announced on the 12th that it would inspect water leisure equipment free of charge to prevent water leisure safety accidents. According to the Yeosu Coast Guard on the 12th, the Korea Maritime Transportation Safety Authority and two professional repair companies will participate in free inspection of motorized water leisure equipment such as motor boats and water motorcycles at Yi Sun-sin Marina in Uncheon, Yeosu on the 16th. Most water leisure equipment accidents occur due to lack of safety awareness, such as neglect of equipment inspection and careless operation, and marine accidents such as drifting due to engine failure can be prevented just by inspection before departure. This free inspection and marine safety campaign for water leisure equipment will raise the safety awareness of water leisure activities and prevent simple engine failures and other drifting accidents, and will also provide safety training for individual players who are not familiar with the equipment, as well as simple maintenance training. An official from the Yeosu Coast Guard said, “Marine accidents can be prevented with a simple equipment inspection before departure,” and added, “We hope that you can enjoy safe marine leisure activities by complying with safety rules such as navigation regulations and pre-inspection before departure.”

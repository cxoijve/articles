It was built and put into service on the 3rd. About 80 people attended the inauguration ceremony, including Choi Jong-wook, head of the port operation department at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Choi Jeong-ki, director of the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Bureau of Jeollanam-do Province, Shin Eui-joon, a member of South Jeolla Province, Shin Woo-cheol, Wando County Governor, Park Ki-jeong, chief of the Wando Maritime Police Station, and heads of organizations related to maritime affairs and fisheries. The ceremony proceeded in the order of awarding plaques of merit, report on ship construction progress, and patrol boat opening ceremony. ‘Maritime No. 3’ was built as an eco-friendly port patrol boat with a budget of 4.7 billion won to ensure the safety of ships at Wando Port, where about 40,000 ships pass through each year. By applying the hybrid system, it can sail at 8 knots (15 km/h) when using electric propulsion and at a maximum speed of 34 knots (63 km/h) using a transit engine when operating at high speed. Choi Jeong-ki, director of Oceans and Fisheries Bureau of Jeollanam-do Province, said, “With the first eco-friendly port patrol boat equipped with a hybrid propulsion system in Jeollanam-do, we are responsible for the safety of ships and port workers using Wando Port, and provide quality port service.” I expect to do it,” he said.

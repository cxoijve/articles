Masan Happo-gu, Changwon Special City, ‘Keep a close eye on consumption trends of marine products at Masan Fish Market’. Kim Seon-min, head of Masan Happo-gu, Changwon Special City, visited the Masan branch of the Anchovy Rights Fishery Cooperative on the 6th to manage the safety of marine products due to the recent discharge of contaminated water from Japan. In order to alleviate citizens' anxiety about the safety of marine products following the discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, Commissioner Kim visited the fishery market and observed the simple radioactivity testing process, publicized the safety of our seafood, and urged citizens to consume our seafood. He also looked at consumption trends, including the status of fisheries product impositions, and listened to the difficulties faced by fishermen and fisheries cooperative officials on the front line. Commissioner Kim is closely monitoring trends in seafood consumption following the Masan Fish Market Festival held on the 25th of last month, and is strengthening promotional activities for fishery industry workers in preparation for the release of a seafood-specific poster that Changwon City is preparing. District Mayor Kim Seon-min said, “There were opinions that the Masan Fish Market Festival to be held on the 25th would be diminished due to Japan discharging contaminated water on the 24th of last month, but we were able to successfully complete the festival thanks to many citizens visiting.” “As inspections are continuously conducted and inspection results are transparently disclosed, we ask citizens to trust the government and the city and use our seafood as much as possible,” he said.

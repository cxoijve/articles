Pohang Coast Guard issues ‘advisory’ warning of danger in coastal waters. Pohang Marine Police Station (Chief Ji-han Kim) issued the ‘Warning’ level of the coastal accident risk forecast system as strong winds and high waves are expected in the East Sea from January 18th to 25th. Coastal accident risk forecasting refers to informing the public of the risk by dividing it into three levels (attention, advisory, and warning) when damage due to a special weather report or natural disaster is expected. According to the weather forecast, strong winds of 9 to 14 m/s and high waves of 2 to 4 m are expected to blow in the East Sea from the 18th, and the wind warning is likely to be prolonged until the 25th. Accordingly, the Pohang Coast Guard recommends that multi-use vessels such as fishing boats and fishing boats in coastal waters enter port early, and plans to strengthen patrols around breakwaters and coastal rocks that are at risk of overtopping and falling accidents.
In addition, we plan to request the sending of disaster text messages to Pohang and Gyeongju cities to provide risk information to tourists visiting the coast and do our best to prevent damage from safety accidents in coastal waters due to bad weather. Chief Kim Ji-han said, “During the cold season, the temperature is low and accidents can lead to casualties in the event of an accident.” He added, “In order to minimize damage from safety accidents, the public needs to make their own efforts, such as frequently checking weather information and complying with safety rules.” .

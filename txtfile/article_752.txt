On the 16th, National Power National Assembly member Kim Byung-wook (Pohangnam, Ulleung) representatively proposed the 'Ocean Survey and Utilization of Marine Information Act', which requires that those who engage in dangerous activities at sea, such as maritime shooting training, notify the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries without delay. said.According to Rep. Kim, five shells fired from a naval vessel in June fell near a passenger ship sailing near Ulleungdo, which almost caused a major disaster, and a loophole was discovered in the process of disseminating training information.The current law stipulates that any person who intends to change marine information according to the annual implementation plan must notify the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries. However, it was pointed out that the problem was that there was no obligation to notify warnings necessary for navigation (shooting training, etc.) and matters related to traffic safety of ships.In order to prevent such problems, the amendment imposes an obligation to notify the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries of relevant information without delay in the case of an act that poses a serious risk to maritime traffic safety, such as maritime shooting drills.If the bill is passed, it will be possible to link it with the 'Maritime Safety Act' (initiated by CEO Kim Byeong-wook), which stipulates that 'the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries must notify shipowners and captains of ships during maritime shooting drills' proposed earlier. It is expected to contribute to the construction.Rep. Kim Byeong-wook said, "We wanted to establish a radio wave system that would provide the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries for those who engage in dangerous activities such as shooting training by supplementing the 'Maritime Safety Act' proposed last time, and the Minister of Oceans and Fisheries transmits the information to ships." We hope that by resolving the zone, maritime safety accidents can be prevented and people can safely go to and from the sea.”

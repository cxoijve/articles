The Incheon Maritime Police Station announced that it will do its best to prevent marine accidents in winter, such as safety management of incoming and outgoing ships and strengthening of the public-private cooperation system to prepare for marine accidents in winter by February next year.According to the Incheon Coast Guard, as a result of analyzing marine ship accidents during the winter season for the past three years (2019-2021), the most frequent accidents occurred in the following order: flooding, stranding, fire, collision, sinking, and capsize. Among them, if we look only at flooding and fire accidents, which are highly likely to cause casualties, the average number of ships in spring and autumn (March to October) is 1.5 and 0.6 ships, respectively, whereas in winter (November to February), 5.7 and 2.2 ships are about 4 appeared about twice as high.In particular, it was analyzed that the number of fire accidents caused by negligence in using heating appliances in ships and the increase in flood accidents of ships that were moored for a long time due to the off-season and rest period were analyzed.Human negligence, such as poor maintenance, negligence in operation, and negligence in management, accounted for 85.8% of the causes of marine ship accidents.Accordingly, the Incheon Maritime Police Station established an area prone to accidents during the winter season, strengthened the emergency response posture such as dispatching rescue forces, safety management to prevent ship accidents in case of bad weather, strengthened the warning system for tug boat operation and the safety management of long-distance fishing vessels, and strengthened patrol in vulnerable areas. It is also planned to respond thoroughly by strengthening the cooperative system for rescue and rescue resources in the private sector.According to an official of the Incheon Coast Guard, “there is a high probability of marine accidents due to the drop in temperature and bad weather due to the nature of the winter season. We ask for attention and interest in preventing accidents.”

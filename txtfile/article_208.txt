Pohang Coast Guard expands and operates visiting coastal safety classes The Pohang Maritime Police Station (Chief Hyung-min Kim) announced on the 19th that it will operate a coastal safety class to visit in 2022 to prevent accidents in the water and spread a maritime safety culture ahead of the peak season for swimming in the summer.The Pohang Coast Guard will start at 10 am on May 19 at Yugang Kindergarten (about 140 people) in Nam-gu, Pohang, and run coastal safety classes for 2,000 people in 20 places including kindergartens and elementary schools in the jurisdiction until August.The Visiting Coastal Safety Class is an educational program where marine police officers personally visit and practice theories and practices such as safety rules for playing in the water, tips for handling marine accidents, how to wear a life jacket, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) according to age.The Pohang Coast Guard plans to expand the coast safety class this year not only to Pohang and Gyeongju, but also to residents of inland areas such as Daegu, where there were few opportunities for marine-related education.An official from the Pohang Coast Guard said, “The interest and concentration of students in the coastal safety classroom where marine police officers directly visit the field is very high. We will continue to conduct active, people-friendly administration to spread a maritime safety culture.”

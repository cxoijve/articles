The World's First Marine Navigation ServicesThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) plans to cut maritime accidents by 30 percent by launching marine navigation services next year.The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) announced the Smart Maritime Transportation Strategy at the 12th Science And Technology-related Ministers' Meeting on Aug. 6.The ministry plans to develop a smart marine navigation system to launch the world’s first marine navigation services beginning 2021.Currently, ships are operated with analog technologies such as radar and voice communication, but these analog technologies have limitations in preventing accidents.The government has developed a marine navigation system through the Korean-style E-navigation Development Project, which was launched in 2016, and has been conducting pilot operations of the system since the beginning of 2020.Marine navigation services will provide automatic collision and grounding alerts, remote monitoring of fire and capsizing risks, optimal route guidance, electronic hydrographical charts, ship entry and departure information, and marine safety and weather information in real time. The ministry explained that marine navigation services are expected to reduce maritime accidents 30 percent.In addition, the ministry will promote international standardization of the smart marine transportation system. It plans to secure marine digital source technologies and establish an international marine digital governance system centered around Korea.Marine experts say that a new 30-trillion-won market will be created when the shipping, shipbuilding and logistics markets use digital systems under the policy of maritime digitalization. The ministry plans to operate a testing site for new technologies with major countries in Korean waters and lead international cooperation by signing business agreements with those countries.Choi Moon-heecontact@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

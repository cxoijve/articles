The Mokpo Branch of the Gwangju District Court is holding an investigation to determine whether to issue arrest warrants for two senior officials of the ferry's operator, Chonghaejin Marine. A marine safety operations director surnamed Ahn and a logistics team leader identified only as Kim have been charged with criminal negligence, accidental homicide, and violation of maritime safety law. The two men are suspected of loading the ferry with too much cargo despite knowing the associated safety risks. Prosecutors say Kim allegedly tried to tamper with computer records on the Sewol's cargo volume upon hearing news of the accident. Ahn is also suspected of embezzling about 30 million won through the sale of scrap metal during the ferry's renovations.

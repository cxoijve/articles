A computer-generated view of the liquefied carbon dioxide carrier vessel developed by Hanwha Ocean.Hanwha Ocean announced on Sept. 21 that they recently signed a Joint Industry Project (JIP) agreement with Greece’s Ecolog, the American ship classification entity ABS, and Scotland’s Babcock LGE to develop a 40,000㎥ class large liquefied carbon dioxide (LCO2) carrier vessel. Through this agreement, the parties will share their expertise and experience related to carbon dioxide carrier vessels. The plan is to create detailed designs and specifications for a large liquefied carbon dioxide carrier vessel that ensures safety and efficiency.The four companies will examine key issues related to vessel operations and also study ways to minimize greenhouse gas emissions during operations. They will also review the varying purity levels of carbon dioxide, aiming to develop an optimal carbon dioxide carrier vessel that incorporates the latest technologies.Leading this collaboration, Hanwha Ocean will oversee a comprehensive review of the ship’s propulsion performance and detailed designs, including the cargo hold, a key feature of the liquefied carbon dioxide carrier vessel. Ecolog will provide global industry requirements and ship operation expertise. As one of the major global ship classifications, the U.S.-based ABS will examine variables based on carbon dioxide purity and review and approve overall design specifications. Babcock LGE, a specialist in cargo operation systems development, will assist in designing cargo operation systems, including re-liquefaction devices.A representative from Hanwha Ocean stated, “Through this joint research, our company aims to complete the development of a liquefied carbon dioxide carrier vessel with optimal performance and gain a competitive edge in this technical field. Given our recognized expertise and high quality in the liquefied gas carrier market, we will maintain our leadership position in this area as well.”Jasmine Choipr@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

The joint investigation team of police and prosecutors is expanding its case into the ferry's operator Cheonghaejin Marine Company.According to prosecutors, the crew members testified that they had received little or no standard safety training.A 2013 audit report showed the marine company spent less than 600,000 won on crew training such as evacuation drills.In comparison, a rival shipping firm had spent more than 18 times that amount during the same period on training programs.Authorities also seized yesterday the Sewol's sister ship -- the Ohamana Ferry -- owned by Cheonghaejin Marine, in an effort to find more clues behind the exact cause of the disaster.

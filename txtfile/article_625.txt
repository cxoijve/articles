Incheon Maritime Police Station (Chief Sang-chun Park) will strengthen coastal water safety management from July 14 to 17 to prevent coastal accidents and damage to coastal facilities in preparation for the contrast period.The contrast period is the period of the month when the difference between the tides is greatest, and it is around the full moon and the eve of the lunar calendar.According to the Korea Oceanographic Research Institute, the water surface will rise up to 949 cm higher than the basic level due to the influence of the supermoon that brings the moon and the Earth closer to the seawater that expanded due to the summer heat this July. Accordingly, the Incheon Coast Guard is planning to prevent marine accidents by issuing a ‘warning’ stage of the risk forecasting system and providing safety information such as road signboards in cooperation with related organizations.In addition, it is planned to strengthen the overall safety management of the coastal waters by providing information broadcasting using electronic signs and broadcasting devices at police boxes, and strengthening patrols in the low-lying areas of the coastal area and in the harbor area, which are vulnerable to flooding.An official from the Incheon Coast Guard said, "To prevent safety accidents caused by sea level rise, fishermen and vacationers refrain from entering the beach, and marine workers are urged to check safety frequently in case of a ship inundation or capsize."

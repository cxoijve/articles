Rep. Yoon Mi-hyang held an international forum to respond to the discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant Polluted Water Discharge Promotion Status, Problems, and Response Direction The <International Forum on Ocean Discharge of Contaminated Water from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan> will be held on April 11th (Monday) at 1 PM, co-hosted by the National Assembly members Yoon Mi-hyang, Seo Sam-seok, Lee Jae-jeong, Kang Min-jeong, Kang Eun-mi, Min Hyung-bae, Yang Yi Won-young, Lee Seong-man, and Lee Su-jin (proportionate). do.In the <International Forum on Response to Marine Discharge of Polluted Water from Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan>, lawmakers and experts from Korea, Japan, the United States, and Australia will participate to examine the current status and problems of ocean discharge of contaminated water from Fukushima nuclear power plant. They will also discuss the need for international solidarity to stop the forced discharge of contaminated water into the sea, which threatens human safety and human rights and marine ecosystems.The forum will be chaired by Rep. Mi-hyang Yoon, and the topic will be presented by Kanna Mitsuta, the Japanese secretary general, Friends of the Earth, and Dr. Helen Caldecott, an Australian doctor and radiation expert, co-founder of the International Medical Organization for the Prevention of Nuclear War.Under the theme of “Promotion and Problems of Sea Discharge of Contaminated Water from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan,” Secretary General Kanna Mitsuta, the Japanese government decided to release the contaminated water from the sea on April 13, 2021 and the situation thereafter. He plans to announce the dangers of radioactive materials, including hydrogen (tritium), and problems in which alternatives to treatment of contaminated water have not been sufficiently reviewed.Dr. Helen Caldecott, who gave a presentation on the topic 'Effects of marine discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan on Pacific coastal countries', introduced the fatal risk of radioactive materials to the human body, and the Japanese government dilutes the contaminated water below the legal standard and releases it. Even so, it will be revealed that radioactive materials are not the correct solution because they are concentrated in living things by the food chain.Then, the US president of the Social Justice Education Foundation Son Seong-suk, co-founder of Tsukuru Force Pacific Asia Anti-Nuclear Peace Coalition, and South Korea's Choi Kyung-sook, an activist at the Citizens' Radiation Monitoring Center, will have a discussion.Son Seong-suk, who works for social and environmental justice in California, USA, said, “Discharging contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean without guarantees for safety and without the consent of the victims and neighboring countries will be a great disaster for mankind and the environment.” “Through joint efforts, we must address the threat of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant,” he said.The co-founder of Tsukuru Force introduced the results of the Mothers for Peace, an anti-nuclear group after the Fukushima accident, collected seawater samples and requested analysis to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Research Center in “California, USA Investigation Results and Recommendations.” Elevated cesium-134 levels are clear evidence that Fukushima pollution has reached the California coast.” “Activists should urge the Japanese government to stop discharging contaminated water into the sea at the national level,” he stressed.Choi Kyung-sook, an activist at the Citizens' Radiation Monitoring Center, proposes a policy to the Korean government to prevent the discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea, which threatens public safety. Activist Choi is working with neighboring countries to oppose the discharge of contaminated water to the sea to prepare diplomatic measures to pressure the Japanese government, lead the environmental impact assessment on the discharge of contaminated water into the sea, establish a public-private consultative body to respond to the discharge of contaminated water into the sea, and undertake the public health division. Fisheries protection measures will be proposed.In his greetings, Rep. Yoon Mi-hyang said, “The Japanese government is pushing ahead with the plan to release contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, regardless of concerns and opposition from neighboring countries, including Korea, and the international community. To prevent the discharge of contaminated water from nuclear power plants into the sea, we will work together to spread the solidarity where citizens of more countries can voice their voices and act.”Meanwhile, the international forum will be held simultaneously in the 3rd Seminar Room of the National Assembly Hall and online video conference (webinar). Anyone interested in the response to the marine discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant and the environment can participate. hpf21@naver.com

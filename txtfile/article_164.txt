Yeosu City gives green light to beauty/spa wellness tourism base project…Establishment of ‘Marine Wellness Center’. Passed the central investment review of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security on the 19th... Investment of 21.7 billion won by 2027 reporter goYongbae. As the ‘Beauty and Spa Wellness Tourism Base Development Project’ of Yeosu City in Jeollanam-do passed the central investment review, the push to develop a wellness tourism base began in earnest.According to Yeosu City on the 20th, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced that the 'Beauty and Spa Wellness Tourism Base Project' was passed in the 3rd regular central investment review, securing 10.6 billion won in national funds and 3.2 billion won in provincial funds for related projects.Accordingly, Yeosu City will invest a total of KRW 21.7 billion from 2024 to 2027 on 19,000 m2 of unused land on National Route 77 near Baekya Bridge to create a 'marine facility' equipped with marine wellness experience facilities such as a spa, island specialty product sales facilities, and a tourist information center. There are plans to build a ‘wellness center’. The idea is to create an island marine tourism belt that responds to the increase in demand for SAFETY tourism in the post-corona era and revitalizes the southern and central marine tourism routes of Goheung, Yeosu, and Namhae by developing wide-area tourism in the southern region.In addition, by creating a space to sell island specialties, we are hoping to build a sustainable community by activating exchanges between residents, while also improving the income of islanders and revitalizing the local economy by selling various specialties from each island.An official from Yeosu City said, “Once the Eleven Bridge and the Yeosu-Namhae Undersea Tunnel are completed, a southern coastal island and marine tourism belt will be created through the revitalization of marine tourism routes.” He added, “We will build a ‘Marine Wellness Center’ at the center of it to become a base for Korean-style wellness tourism.” “We will foster it,” he said.

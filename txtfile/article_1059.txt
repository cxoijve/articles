One sailor dead, two missing in ship sinking. A South Korean naval patrol ship collided with a fishing boat in waters off the southern island of Jeju on Wednesday night, leaving one seaman dead and two others missing, the Navy said Thursday. The 150-ton ship Chamsuri was returning to its base on the island after carrying out a routine patrol mission when it collided with the 270-ton fishing boat about 8.7 kilometers northwest of the Jeju port at around 10:50 p.m., officials said. The ship, which belongs to the Third Fleet based in Mokpo, South Jeolla Province, sank at 1:24 a.m. Thursday, the Navy said.
Of the 30 crewmembers, 28 were rescued by another patrol ship. Seaman Noh Ga-bin, who suffered an injury to his right leg, died due to massive blood loss after he was transported to a nearby hospital. Petty Officer First Class Im Tae-sam and Seaman Apprentice Hong Chang-min are missing.The fishing boat suffered no casualties and the damage to it was minor, officials said.Helicopters, naval ships and vessels from the maritime police have been mobilized to search for the two missing sailors, who officials said could be trapped inside the sunken ship or drifting in the surrounding waters.Navy officials said they are investigating the exact cause of the collision, adding that the exact cause may be verified after they pull the ill-fated ship out of the sea and examine it.
Most of the rescued soldiers were taken back to their base while four of them, who suffered minor injuries, were transported to a hospital for treatment.The collision came when the military was on a high alert to ensure security ahead of the two-day Group of 20 summit to open Thursday.

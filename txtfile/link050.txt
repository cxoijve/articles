Two South Korean fishing boats collided off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, Thursday, leaving three foreign sailors missing.

The collision took place around 6:20 a.m. when one of the boats – the 101 Geumyang-ho heading north toward Russian waters – collided with the 803 Tongyeong-ho and sank, about 600 kilometers southeast of Sapporo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

A total of 38 crew members – seven Korean and 31 foreign sailors – were on board the two ships.

Thirty-five were rescued by nearby ships but three migrant sailors still remain missing.

"The rescued sailors are all in good health, and we have notified their families of the incident," a ministry official said.

The Japanese maritime authorities have dispatched a 1,300-ton patrol ship to search for the missing, according to the Maritime Police.

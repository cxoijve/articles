Incheon Coast Guard conducts emergency rescue of 9 drifting ships in Daemyeong Port and conducts national safety inspection of marine facilities -Break News Incheon Reporter Park Sang-do.The Incheon Maritime Police Station recently rescued and moved nine ships moored at Daemyeong Port in Gimpo-si, Gyeonggi-do to a safe place after the mooring line broke.According to the Incheon Coast Guard, at around 4:06 pm on the 13th, the military base near Daemyeong Port received a report that a ship was drifting, and dispatched a coastal rescue boat to the Daemyung Police Box to identify 9 ships, including ship A (9.77 tons), which were drifting toward Ganghwa Bridge. To prevent secondary accidents, Daemyung Police Station contacted the local safety management and fishing boat owners and captains to safely rescue and move the drifting vessel to Daemyung Port, and there was no human or material damage.In particular, there were a lot of reefs in the saltwater channel of Ganghwa Bridge, which almost led to a major accident, but the Coast Guard was able to prevent secondary accidents such as marine pollution accidents. The Coast Guard believes that the ships drifted because the mooring line was cut due to the rapid current during the Baekjungsaari period, when even the sea level rises to the maximum.An official from the Incheon Coast Guard said, “Special caution is required as safety accidents such as drifting and flooding may occur in ships moored during the contrasting period such as Baekjungsaari.”In addition, the Incheon Maritime Police will conduct a national safety inspection for 59 days from the 17th to the 14th of October to check the preparedness and response posture for pollution accidents targeting marine facilities and cargo handling facilities in Incheon.For this maritime facility national safety inspection, a joint team of related organizations such as the Incheon Maritime Police Station, Incheon Regional Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Office, and Incheon City Hall was organized to ensure that 30 large oil storage facilities with a high risk of large-scale marine pollution accidents are berthing at 30 large oil storage facilities with a high risk of large-scale marine pollution accidents and ships of 50,000 tons or more. A total of 42 sites, including 12 possible cement and coal loading and unloading facilities, will be inspected.Major items to be checked include whether the emergency pollution plan for marine facilities is implemented, confirmation of the results of self-safety inspection, the status of prevention of unloading and scattering of cargo at sea, and prevention and management of self-pollution accidents.In particular, we plan to check whether or not improvements have been made on matters pointed out by the National Safety Team, and continue to manage non-improved business sites until they are completed. Meanwhile, the Incheon Coast Guard contributed to the prevention of accidents by improving 39 cases of detection and detection of 32 oil storage and loading and unloading facilities through the national safety inspection last year.Kim Jong-pil, head of the Marine Pollution Control Division, said, “We will do our best to prevent pollution accidents through joint inspections during the national safety inspection period, and work hard to establish a safety culture by strengthening voluntary safety management in the workplace.”

Namdong-gu plans to establish a solid safety system, such as conducting additional collection and inspection in the future and promptly banning the sale of the fishery product if it is judged unsuitable. In addition, Namdong-gu plans to continuously post 'maritime and fisheries radiation safety management information' through the district website and the 'fishery products safety traffic light' installed at the entrance to the traditional fish market in Soraepo-gu.

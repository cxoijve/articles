Reporter Kim Doo-hwan. 2023 was truly the year of Suncheon. The 2023 Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo (hereinafter referred to as the 2023 Garden Expo), which took place over the entire city as a stage and lasted for seven months, was a huge success, with one in five citizens attending, and ended successfully with a record-breaking profit of 33.3 billion won. That's not all. As a result of preparing for urban change based on the unrivaled values of ecology and gardens from early on, it was even evaluated as setting a new milestone for Korea despite the threat of regional extinction and the climate crisis. According to Suncheon City on the 2nd, Suncheon, which is writing a new history of local autonomy, will be creating a completely different 'K-Disney' in 2024 by dressing up the excellent analog elements represented by 'ecology and gardens' with a new clothing called 'AI and culture'. , Suncheon’ is presented. The power of the three unions shown at the 2023 Suncheon Bay International Garden Expo! Suncheon Mayor Noh Gwan-gyu emphasized that the power of the three was the foundation of Suncheon's diverse achievements. The power of the three, demonstrated by a leader who predicts the future and suggests a suitable direction, public officials who offer wisdom, and dignified citizens, turned various imaginations that everyone said were impossible into reality.Not only did it lead to a decision to bypass the Gyeongjeon Line, which could have passed through the center of the city and hindered urban growth, but also threatened the safety of citizens, it also successfully completed the 2023 Garden Expo, showing mature civic consciousness. Suncheon's achievements have been recognized through external evaluations such as the Local Autonomy CEO of the Year Award and the Special Award for Best Practices for Balanced Development Projects awarded by the Local Era Committee, and have been selected for various public contest projects such as the Korea Cultural City target site and the base industrial complex competitiveness strengthening project. The effect was clearly visible. ‘K-Disney Suncheon’, heading to the future with AI, completed!If 2023 was the year of the Garden Expo, 2024 is expected to be the time to prepare for ‘K-Disney.’ The goal is to develop a new cultural content industry centered on animation in Suncheon, just like Walt Disney, which plays an important role in the American economy through animation. Last November, Suncheon Mayor Noh Gwan-gyu, other related officials, and the Suncheon City Council took the time to see the current state of the animation industry with their own eyes through a field trip to advanced cities in the United States. We directly confirmed the potential of related industries such as Pixar Studio, which provides jobs for over 1,300 people in a creative corporate environment, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), which nurtures creative talent, and Disneyland, which has captured the eyes and ears of people around the world. The city believes that Suncheon's excellent analog elements, including Suncheon Bay and its gardens, can create an environment that can maximize human creativity, and plans to directly perform the same role as the Walt Disney headquarters. By attracting animation-related anchor companies, we are transforming the entire Suncheon area into a base for the cultural content industry, while pursuing designation as a special opportunity development zone with a strategy differentiated from other local governments. In addition, we support the training of relevant talent through collaboration with local universities and further strengthen industry-government-academia cooperation to create Suncheon where young people return. The garden is also being renewed. By adding perfection to the analog garden and incorporating cutting-edge digital technology, it is transformed into a garden that three generations can enjoy together, fun for the young and comfortable for the elderly. Future Suncheon economy prepared by fostering knowledge-intensive future industries. The success of the 2023 Garden Expo not only proved the significantly changed competitiveness of the region, but also led to corporate investment and selection of various public contest projects, contributing to the expansion of the regional economy. The ‘Jeonnam-style Balanced Development 300 Project’ and the ‘Biological Transformation Bio-Specialized Knowledge Industry Center’ are large-scale projects with a project cost of 62 billion won, opening a new horizon for the bio industry in Suncheon. The city plans to develop the Seungju-eup area into a bio industry hub base on the south coast connecting Hwasun and Gimhae through systematic fostering of the bio industry. Hanwha Aerospace is also speeding up the construction of the space launch vehicle forging stand. The space launch vehicle forging stand, which will begin construction in January, is scheduled for completion in 2025 and is expected to become a new future growth engine for Suncheon by establishing a sustainable space industry ecosystem in the future. Investments for the future also continue. In order to attract corporate investment and new industries, the construction of Haeryong Industrial Complex 2-2, an urban high-tech industrial complex, and a national industrial complex will be promoted without a hitch, while the local economy will be reorganized with a focus on high value-added future new industries through continuous corporate attraction activities. A green light has also been given to fostering local talent. Last year, Suncheon National University achieved the feat of being the only one in Jeollanam-do to be selected as one of the top 30 glocal universities, and the city, along with Suncheon National University, is recruiting practical talent focusing on the region's three major specialized fields: smart farm, animation, aerospace, and advanced materials. Actively growing. Expanding the quality of Suncheon Bay to the city center and restoring the urban ecological axis. We will also strengthen preparations for the climate crisis. In order to manage Dongcheon, which has been promoted to a national river, in a more systematic manner, it will be further developed through government funding, from the establishment of a basic river plan to maintenance such as sediment dredging. The quality of Suncheon Bay is also raised to the city center. By restoring damaged wetlands in the Dongcheon estuary, we will expand carbon absorption capacity and take the lead in preserving biodiversity. In addition, a marine garden will be created in the Yeojaman area, making the city the only city in Korea to have both an inland garden and a marine garden. We are also speeding up the maintenance of Okcheon and Isacheon, which connect all parts of the city like a thread. Okcheon and Isacheon, tributaries of Dongcheon, will be renovated to prepare for climate disasters such as sudden torrential rain, while Sindaecheon will be renovated to be reborn as a space for citizens as good as Cheonggyecheon. Creating a luxury residential environment suitable for the era of $40,000 income. The residential environment for citizens' lives is also expected to be significantly improved. The city is preparing to take a leap forward as a high-quality residential city suitable for the era of $40,000 income by discovering new life-friendly policies such as health, medical care, and welfare. Following the start of operation of Dalbit Children's Hospital for the first time in Jeollanam-do last year, this year it is a regionally complete public medical system that allows several hospitals in the area to function as one general hospital. By speeding up construction, citizen safety will be further strengthened. By fostering the horse industry, which combines horseback riding and rehabilitation, we will bring horseback riding, which was considered a high-class sport, into the lives of citizens so that everyone can enjoy high-quality leisure and sports life. In addition, by creating a mature companion culture, we are creating a dignified city where pet owners and non-pet owners coexist. We are also accelerating the completion of Daejabo City. City bus routes will be reorganized to be more rational, and a pleasant walking environment and urban walking paths will be created to create a walking environment for all citizens. In addition, we will create an environment where citizens can voluntarily participate in the realization of a large-scale city through bicycle road maintenance, etc. Lastly, we will also take the lead in changing the resource circulation paradigm. The integrated biogasification facility and the next-generation public resource facility, which were selected through a public contest last year, will be meticulously promoted to improve citizen awareness of resource circulation and utilize the generated energy as a resource for citizens. Suncheon Mayor Noh Gwan-gyu said, “While Suncheon’s excellent analog elements will be further improved, we will also carefully prepare for the coming future by utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as AI and digital.” He added, “We will address various pending issues in the region such as next-generation public resource facilities and green islands.” “I will also use principles to guide the direction and solve the problem wisely,” he said.

An Integrated platform for Vessel-to-shore DataHMM's new fleet control centerHMM has recently opened its land-based fleet control center located at the HMM R&D facilities in Busan, South Korea. This center is designed to effectively monitor and control the operation of HMM’s modern fleet that includes 12 24,000 TEU and eight 16,000 TEU container vessels.HMM said the delivery of the 12 24,000 TEU containerships were completed in September 2020, while eight 16,000 TEU vessels will be included in its fleet in the second quarter of 2021. All 20 ships feature the latest smart ship solutions.The newly-launched fleet control center provides an integrated platform for vessel-to-shore data and increased connectivity. Its real-time monitoring system offers plenty of information with full visibility, including vessel performance, locations, fuel consumption, ocean weather and cargo information, etc.The vessels also can benefit from a remote control system which supports a wide range of vessel operations, including inspection and repair works on the machinery on ships.In addition, each vessel is encouraged to identify and react to an unexpected threat or obstacle both on board and around the ship by sharing information with the fleet control center in a timely manner.HMM said it will continue to analyze the operational efficiency and explore the commercial viability of autonomous ships based on big data collected from the center.Bae Jae-hoon, president & CEO of HMM, said, “Digital capabilities have become a key element in securing a competitive edge. We will accelerate efforts to enhance operational excellence and efficiency in our fleet management." He added, "We will also gradually apply the smart ship solutions not only to our newbuilds but also to the other ships already in operation."Jung Min-heecontact@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

Intensive discussion on resolving residents' anxiety by ensuring the safety of marine products and measures to prevent damage to fishermen (Muan = Break News) Reporter Haksu Lee = On the 31st of last month, Muan-gun, South Jeolla Province, held a countermeasures meeting with relevant departments chaired by the mayor of Kimsan-gun to relieve anxiety among residents and prevent damage to fishermen as Japan began discharging contaminated water from Fukushima into the ocean. At the meeting that day, Muan County Mayor Kim San said, “Residents feel very anxious about the impact of the discharge of contaminated water on our food, and there are concerns that the discharge of contaminated water will lead to a decline in consumption of local specialties such as octopus and seaweed.” He requested that administrative power be focused on alleviating anxiety and minimizing damage to local fishermen. Accordingly, the military will regularly conduct radioactivity tests on seafood distributed irregularly and disclose the results on the county website, etc., and will also expand radioactivity tests on seafood supplied for school meals. In addition, related departments will jointly strengthen enforcement and promotion of country of origin labeling for marine products. The Octopus Festival and YD Festival, which are scheduled to be held before the holiday and in the second half of the year, will also hold events to promote consumption of seafood and promote the safety of seafood. Regarding fishermen, support for the interest difference from fishery policy funds will be expanded to fishermen and English-language corporations who are having difficulties due to the decline in consumption of fishery products. Governor Kim San said, “Going forward, we will strive to minimize damage by relieving residents’ anxiety by strengthening the safety management of marine products and strengthening support for related fishermen and small business owners.”

Pohang City, Homigot Korean Sunrise Festival “Safety is top priority” On the 27th, Pohang City held a final briefing session for the successful hosting of the ‘26th Homigot Korean Sunrise Festival’ presided over by Mayor Lee Kang-deok in the city hall conference room. The briefing session on this day was attended by about 40 officials, including related organizations such as Pohang City departments, Pohang Marine Police Station, Pohang South and North Police Stations, South and North Fire Departments, and event support groups such as the Pohang Youth Chamber, Southern Model Drivers Association, and Marine Accident Rescue Support Group. The final status of the event was checked through departmental countermeasures reports and discussions on collaboration with related organizations and support group officials. According to Pohang City, the Homigot Korean Sunrise Festival, which celebrates its 26th anniversary this year, is a festival that will be held normally for the first time in four years since the coronavirus outbreak, and various programs will be prepared with the theme of dragons to celebrate the Year of the Blue Dragon in 2024. Before and after sunrise, official sunrise events such as North Korean performances, Chinese idioms, New Year's performances, and helicopter congratulatory flights will be held, and there will be various events such as '2024 Tteokguk Sharing' distributed in the form of meal kits and 'Homigot Market' that will warm up the cold wave with experience programs and food. Side events are planned. In particular, container booths were installed throughout the event venue to enhance safety against strong winds compared to previous events, and drones are used to identify and manage crowded areas in real time. In addition, we plan to focus on safety management for each sunrise location by operating a safety joint situation room between related departments and organizations at major sunrise attractions in Pohang, including Yeongildae Beach, including the Homigot event site. Mayor Lee Kang-deok said, “As many sunrise tourists are expected to visit Pohang, we must make thorough preparations to prevent even a single safety accident, and at the same time prepare a variety of sunrise contents to enhance the event.”

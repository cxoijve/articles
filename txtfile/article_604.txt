The South Korean President’s decision to disband the Korea Coast Guard (KCG) would likely cause setbacks in the Ministry of National Defense’s plan to transfer coastal surveillance duty to the KCG by 2021.Source: Yonhap News “The breakup of the KCG would compel us to re-examine the transfer of costal surveillance,” said an official at the ministry Tuesday. “We originally planned to hand over the duty to a marine police agency. But now the transfer could be delayed or rescinded altogether.”“We need to watch how the KCG’s duties are reorganized, but if the new national safety agency takes over marine surveillance, we will need to discuss with the new agency regarding handing over coastal surveillance,” the official said.The ministry announced the ‘defense reform plan for 2014-2013’ in March, which said the army would relinquish its coastal surveillance duty to the KCG by 2021.The transfer decision came based on the conclusion that the army will no longer be capable of performing coastal surveillance as the standing troops would be downsized 111,000 from 498,000 to 387,000 by 2022.“The original plan was to surrender to the KCG the patrol ship-based surveillance of coasts and remote islands and operation of some coastal posts in light of the troop downsizing,” a military official said.

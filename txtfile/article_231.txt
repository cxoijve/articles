Gunsan Coast Guard 'Spring Maritime Traffic Safety Measures' Promotion From March to July… Started special safety management for marine accidents Reporter Kim Hyun-jong The Gunsan Coast Guard, Jeollabuk-do, sets a special preparation period to prevent marine accidents, which occur most frequently during agricultural weapons, from March to July, when the sea is foggy, and promotes maritime traffic safety measures.In particular, based on past statistical data that showed that accidents due to negligence and negligence of fishing vessels were concentrated, the areas vulnerable to marine accidents were designated as areas prone to accidents with agricultural weapons, and training was conducted according to the characteristics of each type of vessel, such as passenger ships and cargo ships.In addition, it is a policy to secure the golden time in the early stage of the accident by flexibly deploying security forces.In addition, by using the multi-purpose broadcasting equipment installed on the southern breakwater of Gunsan Port and Munyeo Island, it provides maritime safety information such as the current status of fog from time to time, and provides training on the prevention of agricultural weapon accidents for marine workers.In addition, the public-private-government cooperation system will also be strengthened through the regional maritime search and rescue technical committee in which related organizations participate.Gunsan Maritime Police Station Chief Kim Choong-gwan (Superintendent) said, "In March, as fishing boats began to operate in earnest, there were frequent accidents in which equipment that had been stopped during the winter season broke down. By strengthening cooperation with the government-military rescue forces, we are ready for an immediate rescue in case of a maritime accident," he said.He added, "Most marine accidents that occur during agricultural machinery are human resources resulting from insensitivity to safety, and when thick fog is forecast, the safety awareness of operators, such as refraining from departures, is more important than anything else," he said. We plan to further strengthen the prevention of various marine accidents by strengthening patrols."Meanwhile, over the past three years, 44% of ship accidents in the seas of Gunsan occurred during the spring agricultural season(March to July). From January to July, 40 low visibility warnings were issued, accounting for 80% of the total.During this period, it was analyzed that the risk of marine accidents such as ship collision, disorientation, and isolation of hepatic rocks increased due to heavy fog.

Rep. Yoon Jae-gap begins a hunger strike to stop the ocean discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant!Strong condemnation of the Yoon Seok-yeol government for giving up the lives and safety of the people The only solution is to stop Fukushima's discharge of contaminated water into the oceanRepresentative Yoon Jae-gap of the National Assembly's Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock, Food, Marine and Fisheries Committee (Democratic Party Haenam, Wando, and Jindo) started a hunger strike from today (20th) in front of the main gate of the National Assembly building to stop Japan from releasing nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima.Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd. started a test operation of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant's marine discharge facility for contaminated water on the 12th, and the Japanese government's marine discharge of contaminated water entered a countdown. As a result, people's anxiety is expanding, and the fisheries industry in particular is strongly protesting, saying that it is a matter of livelihood.Rep. Yoon Jae-gap “The only solution is to block Fukushima’s discharge of contaminated water into the ocean.”In addition, Rep. Jae-gap Yoon, chairman of the Special Committee on Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of the Democratic Party, held a press conference at the Communication Hall of the National Assembly and said, “The release of contaminated water from nuclear power plants into the sea is not only a threat to the life and safety of the people, but also a radioactive terrorism that destroys the entire fishing industry itself.” Since there is no solution other than to fundamentally stop the discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean, we are going on a hunger strike until Japan withdraws its decision to discharge it.”“The Yoon Seok-yeol administration gave only a justification for Japan’s ocean discharge with a formal act of dispatching an inspection team, and dismissed public concerns about the ocean discharge of nuclear-contaminated water as incitement and ghost stories,” he criticized.Lastly, Rep. Yoon Jae-gap expressed his determination, saying, "I will fight together with the people to keep the sea of Korea clean and to prevent damage to our fishermen and fisheries-related industries."On the other hand, Yoon Jae-gap, chairman of the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Special Committee of the Democratic Party of Korea, shaved his head at the 'contest against the import of marine products from Fukushima and condemnation of humiliating diplomacy against Japan' in March, and in April, he personally visited Fukushima, Japan to check the safety of contaminated water from the nuclear power plant.

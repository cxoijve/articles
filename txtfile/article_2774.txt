To Allow People to Virtually Experience Entire Shipbuilding ProcessDaewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) engineers compare an actual ship with the virtual vessel visualized through a mixed reality (MR) system.Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) announced on Nov. 4 that it has developed the industry's first integrated mixed reality-based vessel platform "DW-3000F Surface Vessel MR System," which combines the advantages of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).The MR system allows people to virtually experience the entire shipbuilding process from marketing to design, production, maintenance and crew training for technology transfer.When a ship salesperson turns on a tablet PC at the meeting with a client, a virtual vessel appears in front of them. Then the screen shows weapons systems applicable to the vessel, allowing the client to choose specifications. In addition, the client can choose the engine room equipment for the vessel in the same way. DSME said its clients showed high satisfaction with the MR system, as they could easily check operation procedures and maintenance procedures for major vessel equipment.The technology can come in handy for designers and workers at all times at production sites. In particular, it is expected to reduce shipbuilding costs and prevent safety accidents by preventing repeated problems and risk factors during shipbuilding work.Meanwhile, DSME filed a patent application for the newly built platform in September and is preparing to register it.Jung Min-heepr@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

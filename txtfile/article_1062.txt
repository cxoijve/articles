Mine emerges as most likely cause of ship sinking.The government was yet to make an announcement on what caused Friday`s explosion that split the 1,200-ton Navy corvette Cheonan apart, three days after the warship sank into the West Sea with possibly dozens of sailors still trapped inside.Of the four possible causes - internal explosion, collision with a reef, explosion of a naval mine or a torpedo attack - the government considered a mine most likely, a Cheong Wa Dae official said yesterday."Judging from what the captain of Cheonan said and the condition of the ship, the possibility of a naval mine explosion seems a bit higher than the other three," the official said."But we are looking into all possibilities for now."Even if the explosion were caused by a naval mine, it would be difficult to determine underwater whether it was placed by South or North Korea, he said."It could have been a mine that we placed and failed to retrieve, or it could have been a North Korean mine that drifted from the North," the official said."It would be hard to confirm underwater who laid it."Several survivors from the sunken ship reportedly ruled out the possibility of an internal explosion or a collision with a reef, drawing attention to the scenarios of a mine explosion or a torpedo attack.Naval mines are placed in water and remain there until they are triggered by the approach or contact with a ship.Defense Minister Kim Tae-young said in a parliamentary hearing yesterday that there were no South Korean mines in the West Sea area, suggesting that any mine there would be North Korea`s."There are no South Korean naval mines along the west coast," Kim said in response to a question by a lawmaker on the parliamentary committee on defense."The Cheonan had passed the area (between Baeknyeong and Daechung islands) about 15 times before. The water there is over 20 meters deep, enough for (the ship) to maneuver."Kim said North Korea placed about 3,000 of the 4,000 mines it imported from the Soviet Union during the 1950-53 Korean War in the West Sea and the East Sea."Not 100 percent of them have been retrieved," the minister said. "North Korean naval mines were found in 1959 and 1984."No signs of a torpedo were detected by the warship, Kim said citing a sailor in charge of the torpedo detecting device.North Korea reportedly has defensive minefields near the disputed inter-Korean sea border.The country that lost track of its naval mines should be responsible for an accident caused by them, according to international law experts.The North kept close watch on South Korean helicopters and vessels involved in the rescue of missing sailors, sending an air force plane on patrol to near the Military Demarcation Line early Saturday, according to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff."The North Korean army is keeping vigil," the JCS said in a report to the parliamentary committee."No signs of unusual movements or provocation have been detected. A North Korean air force plane, however, did reach about 30 kilometers north of the MDL at 0:25 a.m. on Saturday."Washington and Seoul have both been cautious talking about the possibility of Pyongyang`s involvement, even though the disaster site is close to the scene of three naval clashes between the two divided Korean states in 1999, 2002 and most recently in November last year.The JCS believes an explosion tore a hole in the rear of the vessel, shutting off the engine and taking the ship down in less than three hours. Officials remain cautious about the cause, however, until specialists are able to reach and investigate the vessel.It was expected to take about a month to pull up the 1,200-ton ship from underwater.

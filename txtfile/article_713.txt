The Central Regional Coast Guard announced that it held a two-day meeting on the 25th and 26th for 17 ‘marine pollution response volunteer leaders’ who voluntarily participate in the response when a large-scale marine pollution accident occurs.According to the Central Coast Guard, the Marine Pollution Control Volunteers was formed in response to the need for a systematic volunteer support system following large-scale marine pollution accidents such as the 2007 spill of the crude oil carrier Hebei Spirit in Taean, South Chungcheong Province.Volunteers are comprised of maritime-related organizations, companies, institutions, and individuals in the central West Sea area under the jurisdiction of the Central Regional Coast Guard, and a total of 349 people are active.At this meeting, 17 marine pollution volunteer leaders working in Incheon Metropolitan City, Gyeonggi-do, and Chungcheongnam-do attended the meeting and conducted training on coastal pest control and use of pest control materials, education on safety rules for pest control work, and discussions on ways to strengthen volunteer pest control response capabilities.An official from the Central Coast Regional Coast Guard said, “When a large-scale marine pollution accident occurs, the quick response of volunteers close to the scene is the most important to resolve the accident.” He added, “The Central Coast Police Agency provides support to strengthen the capabilities of marine pollution response volunteers.” “I will do my best,” he pledged.

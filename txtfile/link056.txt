MIDEAST ISRAEL COLLISION

The damaged bow of the Cypriot ship Salamis Glory is visible as the ship is docked in Haifa port on 31 August 2007 with Israeli navy ships behind. Last night the ship collided with an Israeli cargo ship outside the port, which sank the ship. Israeli rescue personnel rescued 11 sailors from the cargo ship immediately after the collision and sinking, but two sailors were missing. The two missing sailors' bodies were found by divers, twelve hours after the collision. They were identified as Slovak sailors and police said they were the ship's first mate and an engineer.

A Recommendation from State-run Think TankChina is increasingly isolated after the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law.The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy advised the South Korean government to clarify its stance on the Xinjiang Uighur, South China Sea and Hong Kong national security law issues with U.S.-China disputes escalating in non-economic sectors as well as trade.At present, the conflicts are being witnessed in a variety of fields, ranging from COVID-19 and Hong Kong national security law to Huawei 5G equipment and cybersecurity. According to the institute, the frequency of non-economic clashes between the two superpowers is likely to increase with time and China is being increasingly isolated after the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law.“Their economic and financial sanctions are likely to target a small number of individuals and certain enterprises for the time being with the global economy slowing down due to COVID-19,” it explained, adding, “Meanwhile, their disputes are likely to increase with regard to human rights issues, military issues, political issues, and the like. ”Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have controlled their exports to China since July in relation to the national security law.

Russia, Serbia, Bangladesh and Algeria, which supported China’s policy in the region until July last year, withdrew their support in June this year.China’s isolation also has to do with the July 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration that rejected China’s nine-dash line claims in the South China Sea. The United Kingdom is planning to station an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea for military cooperation with Australia.

The joint team of prosecutors and police investigating the cause of the Sewol sinking has requested arrest warrants for two senior officials of the ferry's operator, Chonghaejin Marine. A marine operations director surnamed Ahn and a logistics team leader identified only as Kim are suspected of loading the ferry with too much cargo despite knowing the associated safety risks. Kim allegedly tried to tamper with computer data on the Sewol's cargo volume upon hearing news of the accident. The joint team in Mokpo has been looking into whether cargo overloading and illegal redesigning of the ship may be responsible for the disaster.

Gunsan Coast Guard cracks down on failure to report changes in crew members
Aiming from December 1st to 31st… 26 cases detected as of September this year Reporter Kim Hyun-jong The Gunsan Coast Guard in Jeollabuk-do will carry out a crackdown on non-reporting of changes in fishing vessel crew members from December 1st to 31st.The purpose of this crackdown on non-reporting of fishing boat crew members is to prevent rescue confusion or loss of life due to the fact that the crew members registered in the entry and exit system do not match the actual number of passengers in the event of an accident such as a fishing vessel collision or capsize.According to the Gunsan Coast Guard on the 30th, the number of cases detected for failing to report changes in crew members within the jurisdiction over the past three years was a total of 92 cases(28 cases in 2020, 50 cases in 2021, and 14 cases in 2022).In particular, there was a lack of change in awareness following voluntary reports by fishermen of changes in crew members, leading to an increasing trend with 26 cases detected as of September this year.
Accordingly, the Coast Guard plans to conduct inspections and searches by the police station's coastal rescue boats and patrol vessels to check whether the actual number of people on board matches the number of people reported in the fishing vessel entry and exit management system for fishing boats leaving and entering ports during the Japanese crackdown period.Lee Seon-mi, head of the Gunsan Coast Guard's Marine Safety Division, said, "Reporting changes in crew members is essential information for quick and accurate life-saving in the event of a marine accident," and added, "As the risk of accidents is high in winter when weather conditions are poor, fishermen voluntarily change crew members for safety." "Reporting is necessary," he urged.He added, "If there is a change in crew members, the ship owner or captain must report it by visiting the nearest Coast Guard branch or branch office or using a mobile phone."Meanwhile, in accordance with the Fishing Vessel Safety and Fishing Act, all fishing vessels, excluding fishery guidance vessels, deep-sea fishing vessels, inland water fishing vessels, and fish farm management vessels, must report changes in their entry and exit port reports.If you violate this, you will be subject to administrative measures: ▲ 1st warning, ▲ 2nd fishing suspension for 10 days, ▲ 3rd fishing suspension for 15 days.

The investigation into the cause of the ferry disaster is expanding, as it's been revealed that the Sewol was carrying more than three times the recommended weight of freight and that its cargo may have been improperly stored.The offices of both shipping watchdogs were raided yesterday by authorities, who are on a mission to investigate malpractice in the entire shipping industry.Meanwhile, the joint investigation team is also widening its case into the ferry's operator Cheonghaejin Marine Company.As part of their widening probe, prosecutors issued travel bans on eight current and former executives of the Korea Register of Shipping -- the body responsible for issuing marine safety certificates.Also earlier in the day, investigators said they called in the second son and daughter of Yoo Byung-eun, who was the predecessor of the operator.The two have been asked to return to Korea from overseas by Tuesday to face questioning.

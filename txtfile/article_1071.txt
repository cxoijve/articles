NETHERLANDS SHIP ACCIDENT. An aerial view taken from a helicopter on 06 December 2012 shows Dutch Coast Guard (Kustwacht) vessels navigating near the spot where the Bahamas-flagged cargo ship 'Baltic Ace' sunk after colliding with a container ship in the North Sea, off the coast of the Dutch Zeeland province, the day before, 05 December 2012. Twenty-four people were on board the 'Baltic Ace' during the collision 05 December night off the south-western province of Zeeland. The ship was carrying a cargo of cars. Thirteen were rescued and six crew members are still missing, the Netherlands Coastguard said. The search, which had been halted overnight due to bad weather, resumed at daylight, but authorities put the chances of survival for the missing at near zero.

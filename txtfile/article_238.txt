Dubbed “Marine Navi,” the solution is equipped with an intelligent CCTV and auto identification system that detects obstacles and an unmanned drone named “KT Skyship” that monitors onshore affairs and is able to deliver medical supplies and life jackets at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour. The drone can fly up to 25 kilometers for a maximum of eight hours. Oh Seong-mok (second from left) introduces the Marine Navi system and KT Skyship drone on a yacht in Suyeong Bay Yachting Center in Busan on Wednesday.

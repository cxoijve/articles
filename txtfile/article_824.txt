A recent data shows the number of boat accidents has been on the rise despite efforts to introduce more safety measures following the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014.The data compiled by the oceans ministry showed a total of 2,101 cases of vessel-related accidents were reported in 2015, up 57 percent from a year earlier.Saenuri lawmaker Kwon Sok-chang who brought up the issue, said the figures indicate that countermeasures are not being properly implemented and called for greater efforts to reinforce safety equipment and education.

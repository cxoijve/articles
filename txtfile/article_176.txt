Jeonnam Province, pilot installation of the nation’s first seawater radioactivity continuous monitoring system.On the 4th, the territorial waters of Wando and Yeodo Island... Scheduled to operate automatically 24 hours a day, strengthening marine radiation monitoring including real-time radiation concentration analysis.(Muan = Break News) Reporter Haksu Lee = Jeonnam Province installed a real-time radioactivity continuous monitoring system on a pilot basis on the 4th on the 4th in Wando and Yeodo Island, the starting point of Korea's territorial waters, to verify the safety of radioactive contamination of seawater due to the discharge of contaminated water from Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant into the sea last August. The real-time radioactivity continuous monitoring system is scheduled to be operated automatically and unmanned 24 hours a day, and will inspect the radioactivity concentrations of gamma nuclides (cesium and iodine) and beta nuclides (tritium) in real time.Test results are notified to tourists and residents in real time through monitors installed on-site, and are also transmitted to Jeollanam-do and Wando-gun, which is expected to strengthen immediate response capabilities in case of problems.In the case of marine radioactivity testing currently being carried out at 59 locations in the Jeonnam region (48 coastal and 11 far-offshore), the process of moving to the peak for seawater collection, sampling, radioactivity testing, and announcing the results requires an average of at least 4 days per session, manpower, costs, etc. This is needed.However, the installation of a real-time continuous monitoring system for seawater radiation not only makes efficient testing possible, but also allows testing without being affected by weather conditions or the marine environment.The real-time seawater radiation continuous monitoring equipment being installed this time was developed through a government research support project. It received test certification from the Korea Institute of Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, a Korean Accreditation Organization (KOLAS), and its technology was recognized by supplying it to the Republic of Korea Navy.Choi Jeong-gi, director of the Jeonnam Provincial Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Bureau, said, “The ‘Marine Radiation Continuous Monitoring System’, which will be installed for the first time in the country, will be a good opportunity to inform the public about the safety of Jeonnam waters and produced marine products.” He added, “We will continue to monitor the safety of contaminated water from Japanese nuclear power plants and related marine products.” “We will further strengthen this so that people can consume marine products with peace of mind,” he said.Meanwhile, Jeonnam Province expanded inspections of produced seafood to more than 1,200 cases for all varieties to ensure the safety of seafood. Radioactivity tests are also being conducted at 19 production sites before distribution. In addition, we are thoroughly managing fishery products by operating a village system for safe management.

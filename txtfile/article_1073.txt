Patrol ship sinks, one dead, two missing. A Navy spokesman said Thursday that a Korean patrol ship sank in waters off Jeju Island after a collision with a fishing boat, leaving one seaman dead and two others missing, according to Yonhap News Agency. The spoksman said the 150-ton patrol ship Chamsuri was on a routine mission in waters about 5.4 miles northwest of Jeju Island at around 10:50 p.m. Wednesday when the collision took place, Yonhap said. "We've rescued 28 fishermen aboard and two are still missing," he said. "We've sent several patrol ships and copters to the scene to search for the missing."
The spokesman said that one of the rescued, however, died soon after being taken to a hospital, Yonhap said.

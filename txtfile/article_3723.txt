Koreans will enjoy a holiday free from Covid-19 restrictions for 1st time since the virus outbreakThe government will lift its pre-travel Covid-19 test requirement for inbound travelers from Saturday, believing the ongoing resurge has passed its peak.Korea had required inbound travelers to submit a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 48 hours or a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) confirmation issued within 24 hours of entry before returning home."Starting from Sept. 3, Koreans and foreigners using planes or ships to arrive in Korea do not need to submit a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test negative confirmation result," Second Vice Minister of Health and Welfare Lee Ki-il said during a press briefing on Wednesday. "This measure applies regardless of vaccination history or country of departure."The eased regulation follows a recommendation from an advisory panel of private experts to the Office of the Prime Minister that the government scraps the pre-entry test requirement on Monday, replacing them with post-arrival tests."The scale of the Covid-19 epidemic is on the decline overseas as well, and it has been confirmed that the spread in Korea has also decreased for the first time in nine weeks," Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) Commissioner Peck Kyong-ran said. "We decided to implement the new measures in line with the global trend of no longer requiring travelers to submit negative PCR test results."Some experts have expressed concerns that the new policy may bring about another virus resurge during the upcoming Chuseok holiday, from Sep. 9-12.However, health officials cast aside such worries."There is a chance that infection might increase due to increased travel during the Chuseok holiday," Peck said. "However, the spread is not expected to increase much because the recent viral wave passed its peak last week and has since been on a downward trend."However, the government will recommend that travelers receive PCR tests within a day of entry into Korea, Peck added.A private expert agreed."Covid-19 transmission on planes is not so severe, and the proportion of confirmed cases among inbound travelers is less than 1.3 percent after entering Korea," said Professor Eom Joong-sik, an infectious disease expert at Gachon University Gil Medical Center. "I think it's time to stop the pre-entry test and take measures to strengthen the monitoring period after entering the country to about two weeks and support the cost of testing."As an extension of relaxed control, the government will impose no restrictions on family gatherings or visits while allowing eating inside mass transits, such as trains and buses, and rest areas along expressways during the holiday.Accordingly, the upcoming Chuseok will be the first holiday entirely free from any social distancing rules since the first Covid-19 virus was first found in Korea on Jan. 20, 2020.Meanwhile, the government has decided to introduce a bivalent vaccine that is effective against BA.5, an Omicron subvariant.Health authorities prioritize high-risk groups such as those aged 60 years or older and those with underlying diseases. However, considering the effect of variants, adults over 18 who have already completed their vaccination can also receive the booster shot."We expect the BA.1-based Moderna bivalent vaccine to arrive first," Peck said. "Moderna applied for approval to the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety at the end of July."Peck stressed that the government is also monitoring the development and licensing process of Pfizer's BA.1-based and BA.4 and BA.5-based vaccines."We are working closely with manufacturers to ensure rapid adoption," Peck said.Vaccination of Skycovione, developed by SK Bioscience, will also begin next month.On Wednesday, Korea added 103,961 new Covid-19 infections, including 458 from overseas, bringing the total caseload to 23,246,398, the KDCA said.The country reported 75 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the death toll to 26,764, the KDCA said. The fatality rate stood at 0.12 percent. The number of critically ill patients remained high at 569, down 22 from the previous day.According to the KDCA, about 44.66 million among 52 million Koreans have been fully vaccinated. In addition, about 33.55 million people had received their first booster shots, and 7.16 million had their second booster shots.tweetRelated articles‘Korea has poor surveillance on post-arrival PCR tests'Lee Han-soocorea022@docdocdoc.co.krSee Other ArticlesCopyright © KBR Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution prohibited

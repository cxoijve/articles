Set by KoreaA test run of an LPG carrier built by HD Hyundai Heavy IndustriesAn international standard for liquefied petroleum gas-powered ships was approved at the International Maritime Organization’s 107th Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) meeting in London, the United Kingdom, in June.According to sources in the shipbuilding industry on Aug. 10, LPG ship safety guidelines approved by the IMO were based on a proposal made by the Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries in 2019. Korea took the lead in developing standards for LPG-powered ships because its LPG infrastructure is good and in high demand compared to other countries.LPG has come into the spotlight as a bridge fuel to future eco-friendly fuels such as hydrogen and electricity. Compared to conventional vessel oil, it emits less carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide, and almost no sulfur oxide or fine dust, making it suitable for ship emission regulations. It has high practicality and nice infrastructure compared to other fuels that take time to develop such as hydrogen. It is also easy to store and transport and LPG terminals have been built all around the world.Until now, it has been difficult to build and operate LPG-fueled ships in Korea due to a lack of construction and fuel supply standards for LPG-fueled ships, but with the approval of this international standard for LPG ships, the preparation of domestic regulations for LPG-powered ships is expected to begin in earnest.Kim Eun-jinpr@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

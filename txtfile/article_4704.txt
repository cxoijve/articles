The private companies and local governments have cooperated to solve regional problems through this project.For example, the digital-based energy consumption environment was built by using the power data information of households to get the power consumption information and develop the safety net management platform for vulnerable groups in Gangseo-gu, Seoul. It led to community-based energy-saving activities and the reduction of the burden on the energy-vulnerable class.In order to guarantee the safe movement rights of the island villagers, Sinan County, Jeonnam Province, has built a system that can provide ship operation information such as real-time ship location information, flight, and cancellation information, and island life safety information, and village life safety map.In particular, this year, the development of digital services will be promoted to solve various regional issues such as carbon neutrality, protection of vulnerable groups, life safety, and support for small business owners.In addition, the 'self-solution team', a communication system in which residents, businesses, experts, and local government officials participate together, will be essentially organized, so that residents' opinions can be fully reflected in the entire process of the project.Tongyeong-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, will establish an "eco-friendly festival planning platform based on carbon emission prediction" to reduce damage to residents due to environmental pollution caused by many local festivals.Hanam City, Gyeonggi Province, will support systematic and healthy customized childcare for citizens, through the 'Hanam City Customized Health Habits Project for Prevention of Child Obesity. Goyang City will build a 'Carbon Neutral Blue Goyang Sharing Market Digital Platform' that can easily share, refurbish, and exchange goods to help residents live low-carbon lives.Jin-gu, Busan Metropolitan City, will build 'A Day of Jin', an activity guidance service platform to help isolation of citizens in their 50s to 70s.Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, will build a 'Gwangjin-gu Food Waste Zero Platform for Carbon Neutrality' to solve the food waste problem in low-rise residential areas.“We will actively support solving local problems through digital technology that residents can easily use,” said Lee Jae-young, director of the Korea Local Information Research & Development Institute.“Through this project, we will do our best to address regional problems in our lives and to achieve sustainable digital regional innovation by providing customized services based on the characteristics of the regions,” said Choi Hoon, head of the decentralization office at the Ministry of Interior and Safety.Photo: The Ministry of Interior and SafetyReported by Smart City TodayHannah Parkhannah.park@smarttoday.co.kr다른기사 보기저작권자 © 스마트투데이 무단전재 및 재배포 금지

 10 sailors are missing and 5 injured  after the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Singapore early Monday.

 Search and rescue teams from the U.S., Singapore, and Malaysia were deployed immediately after the incident.
Four of the injured were taken to a hospital in Singapore by helicopter and their injuries were reported to be non-life threatening.
The fifth sailor did not require any further medical attention.

The oil tanker, Alnic MC, a Greek-owned vessel traveling to Singapore from the South Korean port of Pyeongtaek, was also damaged, but had no casualties and hasn't leaked any oil.


 Monday's incident  is the second time a U.S. Navy warship has collided with another vessel in the Pacific in a little over two months  after a collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a freighter off the coast of Japan on June 17th left seven sailors dead. 
 It is also the fourth accident this year for the US Navy's 7th Fleet, which is based at the port of Yokosuka, Japan.


 The US Navy relieved the USS Fitzgerald's captain of his command last week, after coming to the conclusion that poor seamanship and flaws in keeping watch led to the June collision,  after evidence suggested that members of the crew had made serious mistakes.

 The McCain and Fitzgerald are both equipped with the Aegis missile defense system that is part of the U.S. defenses against a North Korean ballistic missile launch.

But in the coming age of sustainable growth, Yeosu's blessed natural environment and its residents' determination to protect it make the city a model of eco-friendly urban life, and an ideal host for the World Expo.Yeosu, South Jeolla Province, is bidding for the 2012 World Expo, under the theme ``The Living Ocean and Coast: Diversity of Resources and Sustainable Activities.'' It is competing with Tangiers in Morocco and Wroclaw in Poland to host the international fair.The odds are high for Yeosu to win the bid, as the World Fair is paying more and more attention to the environmental aspects of technologies and development.Located at the tip of the southern coast where the Hanryeosudo National Park begins, Yeosu is host to 317 small and big islets and is blessed with warm, mild weather. It is also the industrial and trade center of southern Korea, accommodating a cluster of high-tech manufacturing complexes, marine research laboratories, convention centers and beach resorts.With its natural resources preserved in harmony with man-made structures, Yeosu wants not only to serve as a critical area for the development of the southern coastal region, but also to contribute to the future sustainability of the world's marine environment.``The oceans and coasts have long been a starting place for journeys toward new lands, discovering new cultures and new experiences,'' said Kim Jae-chul, chairman of Yeosu's bidding committee. ``The expo will offer an opportunity to discuss the future of the vital ocean and to tap into this treasure chest full of resources and opportunities for both developed and developing countries.''The expo, if it is awarded to Yeosu, will focus on three major categories _ coastal development and preservation, new energy and transportation technologies, and cultural and recreational activities.Forums and seminars will be held to discuss the efforts and roles that international organizations, countries, civil societies and other related parties should undertake for the sustainable development of marine resources.Climate change, high-tech sea transportation, seabed mining, marine pollution control, marine security and safety systems will also be on the agenda of the 2012 expo.Other than the exposition itself, the fabulous scenery of crystal-blue archipelagos teeming with various marine life will present visitors with pleasant rest stops. The Korean government designated the south coast shores as a vast national park.

On the 22nd, Kim In-chang(Supervisor of Public Safety), head of the Seohae Regional Coast Guard, inspected the safety management situation in sea areas prone to coastal accidents and the World Jamboree site in Saemangeum.
 
On this day, Commissioner Kim visited the Byeonsan Police Station of the Buan Coast Guard in Jeollabuk-do in the form of an initial visit, listened to the business status, and held a meeting to encourage the employees' hard work and listen to their difficulties.
 
Afterwards, they moved to Gyeokpo Port and had time to check the safety conditions of the marina, mooring facilities, and small fishing boats, as well as the status of safety facilities. "The mission of the Korea Coast Guard is to create a safe sea so that the public can use the sea safely," he said. "The first step is to prevent marine accidents rather than responding after accidents.
 
At the same time, he ordered, "Make every effort to preemptively manage safety, such as controlling ships based on accurate weather analysis and identifying overloaded ships that cause danger, so that there is no risk exposure to citizens visiting Gyeokpo Port and nearby beaches and tourist destinations."
 
He also moved to Haseo-myeon, the site of the 25th World Scout Jamboree in Saemangeum in 2023, and asked, "Please do your best to prevent accidents through preemptive safety management such as strengthening preventive activities and patrols so that the Jamboree, which is called the Cultural Olympics as a global youth festival, can be safely and smoothly and successfully completed."
 

Meanwhile, Kim In-chang, a Jeju-born superintendent of peace, graduated from Mokpo Maritime University, Dongguk University, Department of Law, and Yonsei University Graduate School of Public Administration.

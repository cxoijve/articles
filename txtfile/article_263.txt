Jeonnam Province discharges contaminated water from Japan… All-out effort to stimulate consumption of seafood Provincial government actively discovers online and offline seafood discount events and mass consumers... Expand promotion and sales channels by holding direct sales markets in large cities such as the metropolitan area (Muan = Break News) Reporter Haksu Lee = South Jeolla Province is resolving concerns about a decline in seafood consumption following the discharge of contaminated water from Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant and implementing various measures to revitalize consumption.In order to recover weakened consumer sentiment, we are actively promoting events to promote consumption of seafood, such as ▲ online and offline discount events ▲ holding direct sales markets in large cities such as the metropolitan area ▲ discovering mass consumers of seafood ▲ seafood promotion campaigns.With an emergency investment of 2 billion won in reserve funds, Jeonnam Province's online shopping mall Namdo Market is holding a discount promotion for Jeollanam-do seafood to celebrate Chuseok.In this special exhibition, you can purchase fresh Namdo seafood at a 30% to up to 50% discount. We plan to focus on selling seafood to all citizens through online discount events linked to large online platforms such as Kakao and Coupang.Previously, Jeonnam Province worked hard to sell and promote seafood by operating a direct transaction market to promote consumption of marine products not only online, but also at the provincial office in August and at Cheonggye Plaza in Seoul and Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do in September.In the future, we plan to actively expand the sales channel for marine products by holding promotional exhibitions for marine products in metropolitan areas such as Seoul, Gwangju, and Gyeonggi-do together with fisheries cooperatives and fishermen's organizations, promoting excellent Jeonnam-made marine products to consumers in urban areas and selling them at low prices.An event where Onnuri gift certificates are refunded when purchasing seafood at a traditional market is also being held until December 15th. If a consumer who has visited Mokpo Jayu Market, Dongbu Market, or Gwangyang Jungma Market submits a receipt for the domestic seafood purchased at the market, they will receive an Onnuri gift certificate worth 10,000 won for fish worth over 25,000 won and 20,000 won for fish worth over 50,000 won. You can get a refund.We plan to expand the supply of seafood to public institutions such as local governments. We are also working to discover large consumers of seafood by actively requesting that private companies and public institutions, such as large corporations and industrial complexes, purchase seafood for use in their cafeterias.In addition, in order to alleviate the burden of shopping cart prices for vulnerable groups and promote seafood consumption, we plan to provide seafood packages to 2,000 vulnerable households in the province. We plan to restore consumer sentiment through active promotion and information delivery on the safety of marine products.Park Sang-mi, head of the Jeonnam Province Fisheries Distribution and Processing Department, said, “We will proceed without a hitch with consumption promotion measures to help fishermen who are in trouble due to the decline in seafood consumption,” and added, “I hope that the people will also trust and patronize clean Jeonnam seafood.”

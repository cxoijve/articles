From July 1st to August 31st, the Central Regional Maritime Police Agency will strengthen the safety management of multi-use vessels such as fishing boats and guiding boats in preparation for the summer vacation season.According to the Central Coast Coast Guard, there have been a total of 282 maritime safety accidents related to fishing and fishing boats and multi-use vessels such as tugboats and pilot boats in the past three years.Among them, 41 accidents (about 15%) occurred during the summer (July-August), and most of them occurred due to negligence in safety, such as engine damage or failure of propellers.Since there have been many restrictions on outdoor activities due to COVID-19, it is expected that the demand for sea vacationers and marine leisure activities will increase this summer, and the plan is to do everything possible to prevent marine accidents and manage safety.During the safety management period for multi-use vessels during the summer vacation season (July 1 to Aug. 31), the Central Coast Guard formed a 'guided and piloted inspection team' to intensively inspect outdated ships or piloted vessels with a history of accidents, It plans to actively respond to maritime accidents by deploying patrol vessels, such as coastal rescue boats, on the entry route.In addition, special crackdowns on drunk driving, which have been on the rise for the past three years, will be implemented, and joint crackdowns on illegal fishing activities will be carried out in cooperation with Gyeonggi-do and local governments.“We will do our best to prevent accidents and manage safety of multi-use vessels so that people who must have been very tired from Corona 19 can spend a safe and enjoyable summer vacation at our seas,” said the head of the rescue and safety division of the Central Coast Guard.

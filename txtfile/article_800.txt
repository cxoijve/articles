On Wednesday evening, hordes of people were relishing raw fish at Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market ― a rare scene of late due to growing fears over Japan's release of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean.Some of those who ventured to the nation's largest fish market in southern Seoul were there with a common sentiment, wondering when or if they would next visit because of concerns about the safety of seafood."I abruptly decided to visit with my friend after hearing news about the upcoming water discharge," Lee Na-yeon, 26, told The Korea Times, referring to Japan's plan to begin dumping wastewater on Thursday.Lee Jung-sook, 26, accompanied by her friend, also said, "I like raw fish, so I'm a regular visitor here. But now, amid concerns over the radioactive wastewater issue, I am questioning if I will visit again for a while."As the two 26-year old women expressed, the Fukushima water release is sparking concerns among many locals, with fisheries markets falling financial victims.On Thursday, Japan initiated the release of contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, with the dumping expected to continue for at least the next 30 years."Even though the Chuseok holiday is around the corner, everyone here is worried that business will not go well due to the radioactive wastewater matter," said Kim Duck-ho, a chief of the promotional team at the Noryangjin market.The woes among merchants are carried across the board by seafood market merchants."I have not had a single customer today (until 4:30 p.m.)," a fishmonger at Mapo Agricultural and Marine Products Market in western Seoul told The Korea Times, Tuesday, hours after the Japanese government announced its release plan.There were only six people looking around to purchase seafood, while all the merchants at marine product stalls were sitting around on chairs, waiting for customers to appear."I've been selling products here for 25 years, and never before have I experienced such a profound recession," said Jung Yang-ho, a president of the merchant association of the Mapo market."Ever since Japan brought up the issue of discharging radioactive water into the ocean, our marine product sales have been on a continuous decline," he added.

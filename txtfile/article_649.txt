The ROK Marine Corps announced Friday morning that an investigation committee was formed immediately after Tuesday's accident,  and that it is likely to include private aircraft experts as recommended by the families of the victims. The investigation committee has been gathering witness testimonies and footage of the crash,  and is attempting to retrieve the helicopter's blackbox. A marine official told Arirang News Friday afternoon,  that the crashed helicopter had been regularly checked for safety every fifty hours it flew,.. and it had logged just over 150 hours of flight history.The official said the level of vibrations during the helicopter's flight got worse from the end of June,  so it went through additional repairs and maintenance for about two weeks in early July.Tuesday afternoon's fatal test flight came,  as experienced marine helicopter pilots as well as other marines were attempting to see if the vibration issue has been resolved.  The helicopter hovered for about five minutes at the height of three-point-three meters,  before taking off,.. but it crashed only a few seconds after it took off, as its rotor blades fell off.The marine official also said,   the investigation committee is considering including foreign aircraft experts,  who have investigated a similar helicopter crash in Norway in 2016,  where a helicopter's rotor blades detached,.. killing 13 people.South Korea's defense chief has also expressed his deepest condolences over the incident and vowed it would be investigated thoroughly.In a statement on Thursday evening,  minister Song Young-moo also wished the marine who was badly injured in the crash a full and speedy recovery.Vice defense minister Suh Choo-suk also met with the bereaved family members Friday afternoon to closely listen to their opinions.The amphibious MUH-1 chopper was exclusively developed for the Marines by Korea Aerospace Industries, which delivered four of them earlier this year.

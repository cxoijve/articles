SK hynix’s bio image sensorSK hynix is poised to commercialize its newly developed bio image sensor, aiming to secure a stronger position in the global market by not only focusing on mainstream smartphone and automotive image sensors but also pioneering unique product lines.On Nov. 21, it was reported that SK hynix unveiled its bio image sensor at the SK Tech Summit 2023 held at the COEX convention center in the Gangnam district of Seoul. This sensor, a 50-megapixel product, features the world’s smallest pixel size of 0.56 micrometers. An image sensor, akin to the human eye, is a semiconductor chip. SK hynix has modified the structure of traditional camera image sensors to create this bio sensor. The most significant change is in the microlens structure placed over each pixel, adjusted to account for the different light paths and qualities detected by sensors used in mobile, automotive, and mixed reality cameras.Operating devices equipped with SK hynix’s special image sensor is straightforward. When light is shone on a sample, the sensor detects the transmitted light, enabling the identification of material states. For example, it can precisely differentiate between microorganism movements and floating microplastics in marine pollution water samples. SK hynix claims this sensor can replace biological microscopes.The bio image sensor is a “digital essence.” When devices with this sensor are connected to personal computers (PCs) or information technology (IT) devices, much more detailed images can be obtained. Everything is manipulated digitally, offering simplicity and intuitiveness. Furthermore, it allows magnification down to 1 micrometer, enabling detailed observation of objects. An SK hynix official explained, “This image sensor can observe 80% of the range of a conventional microscope and is cheaper compared to advanced biological microscopes that use complex optical systems.”SK hynix developed its bio image sensor in collaboration with domestic company SME SOL. A prototype is expected to hit the market by the end of the year, with plans to ramp up production. The company intends to embed artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the device by collaborating with SK semiconductor affiliates, allowing it to analyze hidden data in samples.SK hynix’s venture into the special image sensor market reflects the semiconductor industry’s shift towards a variety era of small-quantity production. While currently about 60% of image sensor revenue comes from mobile devices such as smartphones, the rise of AI and the Internet of Things has expanded the usage of image sensors in various fields.At the moment, SK hynix holds less than 5% of global image sensor market share. To compete with industry leaders like Sony, which holds a 50% share, and Samsung Electronics, the company is actively exploring various applications for image sensors and targeting niche markets. SK hynix had previously established a dedicated image sensor research and development center in Japan in 2019 to enhance technology and identify new applications.Jasmine Choipr@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

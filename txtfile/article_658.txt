Accordingly, ships with a high probability of causing a marine accident should be removed from oil in advance, and if dangerous situations such as drifting, marine accident, or oil spill occur by sharing with related organizations, we plan to respond jointly and immediately notify the owner or manager to take action.Kim Jong-pil, head of the Marine Pollution Control Division, said, “It is important to safely dispose of the oil left on the vessel in advance to prevent marine pollution accidents. We will continue to monitor,” he said.

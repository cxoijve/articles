The award ceremony for the ONE Marine Safety and Quality Campaign 2022 (August to September 2022) was held on November 24th, 2022, onboard the ONE Helsinki in Singapore. All feedback given was analysed in terms of relevance and effectiveness of applicability across vessels. A commendation was then awarded to the ONE Helsinki for the best feedback given. Nine (9) other vessels were also awarded with this commendation and through the campaign, many other valuable feedback was received from all participating vessels. Finally, the analysis of all individual feedbacks from vessels was circulated within the ONE fleet, successfully achieving the objectives of this campaign. ONE conducts Marine Safety and Quality Campaign annually with specific areas of focus to improve on safety & quality of fleet vessels. This year's theme was "Safety Consciousness â€“ A Step Ahead." One of the main objectives was to enable an exchange of knowledge on Good practices and commonly found Observations, between ONE and the individual fleet vessels to enhance safety & quality. ONE would like to express our gratitude to the crew members and related parties for their tireless persistence for safety and quality at sea as well as operations ashore even during the COVID-19 situation. ONE will continue to work with all shipowners to maintain safe navigation, protect the marine environment and commit to continuously delivering reliable and quality services to our valued customers. < Korea Shipping Gazette >

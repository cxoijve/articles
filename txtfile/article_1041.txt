Danube ship sinking may have been 'predictable' due to overcrowding of tourist ships: local media. News of the cruise ship sinking in Danube has sent ripples of shock throughout Hungary. Local reporters said this accident might have been a tragedy waiting to happen. While it is common to see many tourist ships cruising along the Danube,  Budapest-based reporters say big ships in the river can often cause congestion,  and with heavy rain, high tide and poor night visibility,  chances of a collision were more than likely. "A Hungarian newspaper found one of the cruise member of the hotel motor ship and he told them they were actually expecting an accident. That these huge boats can't somehow see the small ones. Also there were some motor boats and some dinghies and so it's really, really dangerous and there were no regulations about how many boats can have sightseeing in this one or two hours period."Still, it came as a shock as the last major accident on the scenic river took place over 7 decades ago. "It's a complete shock. We haven't had such an accident like that (   ) for many, many years on the Danube. There were accidents when two ships collided but nobody was hurt. This was unexpected, very exceptional." According to Euronews, the investigation has expanded to a nationwide probe along the Danube river,  with cooperation from Serbian authorities.However, chances of finding additional survivors are "diminishing." "The temperature of the river is just about ten, 12 degrees Celsius  and it's running fast and it's very hard to even swim in it."The river has been closed off during the investigation. "First they need to build up the case and after we will see. But in the first part, it looks quite obvious that it should be the fault the human error of the captain of the boat of the hotel."

The government on Sunday announced plans to bolster regulations on drunken sailing, a move that comes in line with enhanced public awareness on marine safety following the mid-April Sewol ferry disaster that left more than 300 people dead or missing.The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said it has issued an advance notice of revised legislation that strengthens the level of drunken sailing to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.03 percent from an earlier 0.05 percent.The marine industry's benchmark level for sailing under the influence of alcohol had been lower compared with other means of transportation. The standard in the aviation industry stands at 0.03 percent and that in the railway sector had been also tightened to 0.03 percent following the deadly ferry sinking.Under the revision, the crew members of ships bigger than 5 tons will be subject to a fine up to a maximum of 15 million won (US$14,479) or two years in prison if they are found to have sailed under the influence of alcohol. The same rule applies to operators of ferries and fishing boats under 5 tons, which are easily prone to casualties.Operators of ships under 5 tons, with the exception of ferries and fishing boats, are subject to pay a penalty of 500,000 won if their blood alcohol concentration comes in between 0.03 percent and 1 percent.The number of drunken sailing cases came in at an annual average of 113 over the past five years, with the number of accidents incurred by drunken sailing reaching 11, according to government data.

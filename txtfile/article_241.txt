'Warning' issued for risk forecasting in the coastal waters of the East Sea Pohang Maritime Police Station (Chief Hyung-min Kim) issued a warning stage for the coastal accident risk forecasting system from the 25th to the 27th to prevent safety accidents in coastal waters as strong winds and high waves are expected along the East Sea coast.Coastal accident risk forecasting means that when damage is expected due to weather warnings or natural disasters, the risk is classified into three levels: ‘interest’, ‘warning’, and ‘warning’ to inform the public.
Kim Hyung-min, chief of the Pohang Maritime Police Station, said, “For the prevention of marine safety accidents for the public, when a storm warning or swell wave is forecast, the marine weather is very bad, and there is a high probability of a safety accident due to a swell wave in the coastal lowlands or breakwater. We will refrain from entering breakwaters and tidal rocks and actively cooperate with the control of safety personnel,” he emphasized.

The Busan Prosecutors' Office has imposed travel bans on eight former and current employees of the Korean Register of Shipping including its ex-president Oh Kong-kyun.According to the special investigation team in Busan, the eight are suspected of embezzlement and breach of trust, among other charges.The Korean Register of Shipping, or KRS, is an agency commissioned by the government to carry out inspections of maritime vessels.Prosecutors say they're looking into allegations that the KRS failed to enforce safety regulations and conduct thorough inspections of the Sewol Ferry.The KRS had approved the renovations to the ship from 2012, which investigators say compromised the stability and safety of the vessel.The Korea Shipping Association is also coming under fire as it allegedly approved documents by the ferry's operator regarding its cargo.The shipping association is responsible for routine safety inspections, but records show the Sewol ferry was carrying more than three times the recommend weight of freight and that its cargo may have been improperly stored.The offices of both shipping watchdogs were raided yesterday by authorities, who are on a mission to investigate malpractice in the entire shipping industry.Meanwhile, the joint investigation team is expanding its case into the ferry's operator Cheonghaejin Marine Company.According to prosecutors, the crew members testified that they had received little or no standard safety training.A 2013 audit report showed the the marine company spent less than 600,000 won on crew training such as evacuation drills.In comparison, a rival shipping firm had spent more than 18 times that amount during the same period on training programs.Authorities also seized yesterday the Sewol's sister ship "the Ohamana Ferry" owned by Cheonghaejin Marine, in an effort to find more clues behind the exact cause of the disaster.

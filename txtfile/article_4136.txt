More Korean companies participate in 'CES 2024'that is hotter than ever beforeMetaEduSys aims to enter the global market by showing off its technology at 'CES 2024''CES 2024', the mammoth home appliance and IT technology event, attracting attention from all over the world, is now just 10 days away.'CES 2024', which will be held for four days from January 9th to 12th with the beginning of 2024, is a venue where technology companies around the world showcase the latest technologies and explore new business avenues. It is no exaggeration to say that this is an event that attracts all eyes from all over the world.Metaverse and Artificial Intelligence(AI) are the two trending technologies that have been leading the global IT industry over the past few years. Although several years have passed, the high level of interest in them can still be considered valid. Among the exhibitors in the relevant fields is MetaEduSys Co., Ltd. that especially stands out in the metaverse field. Headquartered in Andong, South Korea, this is its second time at CES.MetaEdusys is a company with exceptional strengths in disaster safety VR educational solutions, and will be exhibiting VR software on disaster situations with the themes of 'wildfire prevention', 'ship evacuation', and 'fire prevention' at this event. It has already established itself as one of the leading companies in the disaster safety VR software market in its own country.Having shown rapid growth since its establishment in 2017, it introduced VR software for training on how to respond to disasters such as fires and ship accidents at CES last year. The company came back with a new disaster safety content called 'VR Wildfire Education', which is conducted in an 'open world' style - somewhat unfamiliar in the industry - with a wildfire situation as the background.This VR software, based on the global issue of 'wildfires' that has been imprinted on people around the world, aims to raise awareness of the dangers of large-scale disasters like wildfires, and to encourage the public, private and corporate sectors to work together to address environmental issues.As can be seen from this, the content has been created not only for general consumers, but also with all walks of life, including governments and corporations, in mind. These messages from those who call for the general public, governments, and companies to pay more attention to national and global disasters by linking major disasters such as wildfires to national or global environmental problems are well reflected in this VR software.In addition, the company will also demonstrate the 'ThermoReal' technology, which allows users to feel the heat of a fire on their skin or the coldness of a low-temperature situation within the content. This technology, which adds realism to VR experiences by attaching flexible thermoelectric element parts to HMD devices, is not only effective in improving the efficiency of VR education, but is also an innovative technology that can be widely used throughout the industry.MetaEduSys, widely known in Korea for developing disaster experience educational VR software for effective education, has been introducing the VR software and content at various events. At this year's 'CES 2024', they will present their 'Disaster Experience VR' series and meet with global visitors. While Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, the global giants based in Korea, will showcase their technological prowess that will lead global technology trends, it seems that this small startup in the country will also demonstrate their technological prowess on a global scale that cannot be looked down.Jonghee Bae, CEO said, "We have released a number of VR educational software on disaster safety and have been recognized for our technological prowess in Korea, but showing them to the global market is another matter." She expressed her feelings about being invited to the huge event, saying, "We will continue to focus on developing innovative software and content to be recognized for our technological prowess and marketability in the global market."MetaEduSys, has obtained grade 1 in GS certification on 'Survival Swimming VR', 'Ship Accident VR', 'Fire Prevention VR', 'Maritime Safety VR', and 'Carbon Neutrality VR', and has a high level of competitiveness in VR educational content on disaster experience on a global stage like 'CES 2024'. It will serve as a good test bed to see if their technological achievements, which have already been verified by the industry and users in Korea, can also be recognized in the global market.권찬민 기자dduijje321@naver.com다른기사 보기저작권자 © 국제뉴스 무단전재 및 재배포 금지

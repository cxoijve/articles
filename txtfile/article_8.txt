Rep. Yoon Gun-young said, "Elegant youths of Baedal Minjok rider rank first in industrial accidents again last year." Woowa young people in charge of logistics of "Baedal Minjok" recorded the disgrace of being the No. 1 industrial accident company in all industries in 2023 following 2022. According to the data submitted by Democratic Party lawmaker Yoon Gun-young from the Korea Labor Welfare Corporation under the Ministry of Employment and Labor on the 4th, the number of industrial accidents applied from January to August this year was 19,811. 16,924 cases were recognized as industrial accident benefits, with an average of 70 cases per day. Among them, 107 cases of survivor benefits approved when a business operator dies while working were approved for 8 months, which means that worker deaths occurred about once every two days. A total of 1,319 applications for industrial accident benefits and survivor benefits were filed by workers belonging to Woowa Youth, which had the most industrial accident applications. Of these, 1,278 cases were recognized as industrial accidents. Woowa Youth, along with Hyundai Motor's Dongbu Service Center, ranked first with seven applications for survivor benefits during the same period. In particular, all seven of the seven cases were applications for survivor benefits due to accidents. This shows that riders who mainly use motorcycles to deliver have a high risk of accidents. Woowa Youth topped the list of industrial accident approvals (1,837 cases) for all companies in 2022. The number of industrial accident approvals among elegant young people is increasing rapidly every year to 31 in 2018, 163 in 2019, 376 in 2020, and 941 in 2021.Meanwhile, Coupang Eats, a platform company similar to elegant young people, approved 181 industrial accidents (19th) this year. Coupang affiliates such as Coupang Eats were listed in the top 50 by four companies (Coupang Fulfillment Service Daegu Center, Coupang Co., Ltd., Coupang Logistics Service Limited, and Coupang Eats Service Limited). The number of industrial accident approvals by Coupang-related companies was 1,087 for 8 months, and the approval of survivors' benefits was one. In terms of the number of industrial accident applications, it was followed by elegant young people, followed by Hyundai Heavy Industries (general 756, bereaved 7), Korea Coal Corporation Dogye Mining Office (general 693, bereaved 4), Hyundai Motor Dongbu Service Center (general 537 and bereaved 7), Daewoo Engineering & Construction (general 492, bereaved 3), Kia Motors' Hwaseong plant (general 429, bereaved 3), Coupang Corporation (general 360, bereaved 2), and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (general 346, bereaved 2). When analyzing the top 50 companies for application and approval for industrial accidents by industry, industrial accidents were overwhelmingly large in the construction industry. In terms of the construction industry alone, Daewoo E&C (general 467, bereaved 2), Hanwha (general 304, bereaved 0), Hyundai E&C (general 285, bereaved 2), GS E&C (general 270, bereaved 1), and Samsung C&T (general 200, bereaved 1). In response, Rep. Yoon Gun-young said, "Elegant young people have become the number one company in frequent industrial accidents following last year." "The company promised to supplement the system to ensure safety, but the figures have not changed at all," he criticized. Lawmaker Yoon continued, "In particular, if we look at the death statistics of platform companies higher than the construction industry, it is questionable whether the issue should be left to the private sector's autonomous will anymore," and pointed out, "The government, including the Ministry of Employment and Labor, should come up with measures to strengthen closer safety management."

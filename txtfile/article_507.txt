The Incheon Maritime Police Station announced on the 26th that it had cracked down on three people, including the captain of the fishing boat A, in their 60s, who caught blue crabs by driving piles on the tidal flats along the Yeongjongdo coast and illegally installing nets (aka: dry nets) for violating the Fisheries Act.According to the Coast Guard, it was revealed that three people, including Mr. B, systematically installed large-scale nets to catch fish without permission, using the time when the water receded in the tidal flat near the northern end of Incheon Bridge from around March of this year.In addition, it is known that the location where the fishing gear was installed was exposed to marine safety accidents, such as obstructing the entry and departure of ships because it was near the route.Under the current law, fishing without permission is strictly prohibited, and violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment for up to three years or a fine of up to 30 million won.The Incheon Coast Guard is planning to investigate whether there are more persons participating in systematic illegal fishing in order to uncover the additional crimes of the three arrested. He said that he will take strict measures against indigenous illegal fishing that is chronically perpetrated.

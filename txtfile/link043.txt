The 55,000-ton freighter Gravity Highway was on a test run when it collided with Maritime Maisie, a tanker carrying over 29,000 tons of inflammable chemicals early yesterday morning.

The impact resulted in a gaping hole and a fire aboard the tanker, which was eventually put out, but officials are now concerned the ship could break in half and sink.

The coast guard said it plans to move the remaining toxic chemicals on the ship and remove its fuel before towing it.

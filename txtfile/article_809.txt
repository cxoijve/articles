Tomorrow, Japan will release wastewater from its damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant.While the South Korean government says there's no scientific or technical problems with the planned discharge, officials pledged to still make sure the process is done in a way where the safety and health of citizens are protected.Choi Min-jung has this report.With Japan set to proceed with the release of Fukushima wastewater as soon as Thursday, the South Korean government has determined that there are no scientific or technical problems with the planned discharge. Speaking at a briefing on Tuesday afternoon the first deputy chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination Park Ku-yeon stressed that this, however, does not mean that the government accepts or supports the wastewater release."Our government concluded today that we will ask Japan to immediately stop the discharge, if the actual process goes differently from what was planned, as it would threaten the safety and health of our people."In order to enhance the transparency and reliability of the disposal, Park said South Korea has consulted with the IAEA and Japan about having Korean experts participate in the on-site inspection operated by the IAEA.The Korean government also asked Japan to immediately stop the release and notify the government, if something unusual occurs.Lastly, South Korea has requested the sharing of real-time information for prompter, transparent monitoring.In response, Japan, in cooperation with the IAEA, agreed to post relevant data online every hour, with the information provided in Korean as well.To ease concerns,.. the government announced its future plans aimed at protecting the safety and health of people in Korea."As we have done so far, our government will focus on the health and safety of the people and respond transparently and promptly, while doing our best to minimize damage to fishers and the fisheries industry."First, the government plans to significantly expand the scope of monitoring to include the waters near the Pacific Islands and the Northwest Pacific near Japan.Authorities also vowed to expand simulations using actual data obtained after the release,.. to reflect what's really going on.The government has been judging that the impact of the release on domestic waters and marine products will not be significant.
This comes as results from various simulations have shown that radioactive substances from the wastewater would flow into Korean waters,.. several years later in a considerably diluted state.

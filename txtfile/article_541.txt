The Saenuri Party and government held a meeting to amend the governmental organization law Wednesday and agreed to disband the Korea Coast Guard (KCG) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and integrate them into a national safety agency, which is set to be established. They came up with a revised plan of entrusting the initial investigation authority to the new national safety agency.Source: Yonhap News Earlier, the government had proposed a governmental organizational law that transfers the coast guard’s entire investigation authority to the Korean National Policy Agency (KNPA).“The public misguidedly believes the break-up means an outright removal of [functions of] the KCG, but this is not true,” said Yoon Young-suk, the Saenuri Party’s spokesman at the National Assembly. “The new national safety agency will have a marine safety headquarters and perform the duties of the coast guard such as rescue and surveillance, inspection of illegal fishing and prevention of environmental pollution.” The spokesman added “the government’s plan was to hand over all of the probe authority to the KNPA, but it was decided that [the new agency] retains the initial investigation authority.” A senior official at the Ministry of Security and Public Administration said “the decision came because it is impossible to respond to Chinese illegal fishing boats without the initial investigation authority.”The ruling party and government decided not to determine this time whether to promote fire fighters, who currently belong to local governments, to national public servants. However, they decided to increase next year’s budget for equipment support to 100 billion won ($95.0 million), about five times larger than the government’s initial budget plan.

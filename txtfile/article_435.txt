The Incheon Maritime Police Station (Chief Sang-chun Park) is promoting measures to strengthen safety management for 72 days from the 21st to May 31 for safety management during the spring holiday season, when the number of users of multi-use vessels such as wireline, pilotage and fishing boats increases.As a result of analysis of statistics for 2021 by Incheon Maritime Police Station, the number of passengers using multi-use vessels in Incheon during the spring holiday season is approximately 310,000 out of 1.33 million passengers.As a result, the number of marine accidents and safety violations for multi-use ships also increased, and the number of occurrences gradually increased from March, showing that 35% of the total 23 cases in 2021 occurred between March and May.In particular, in spring, fog occurs frequently and visibility is poor, which increases the risk of accidents. The Incheon Coast Guard is planning to preemptively conduct maritime safety maneuvers to prevent safety accidents.In addition, out of 31 violations that occurred in 21, 22 cases (71%) occurred between March and May alone, and they announced that they would intensively crack down on safety violations of multi-use vessels that continue to occur during the weak spring holiday season.As for the contents of the reinforcement period, on-site guidance inspection of safety-vulnerable areas through maritime safety maneuver inspection, inspection of the implementation of safety management for fishing boats, and special crackdown on multi-use vessels to eradicate safety-impeding acts are planned. An official from the Incheon Maritime Police Station said, "To prevent safety accidents during the spring holiday season, when the number of multi-use ship users is rapidly increasing, we will continue to promote on-site publicity and establish a safe order for safe multi-use ship operation through strict law enforcement through special crackdowns." Above all, the safety awareness of operators, captains, and users themselves is important,” he said.

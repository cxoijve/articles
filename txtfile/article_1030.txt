The Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruiser, identified as Yuriy Chaplinsky, was released from custody on Thursday, after a Hungarian court upheld its earlier decision to grant him bail,  despite the prosecution's appeals for him to stay under lock and key.
His bail was set at 53-thousand U.S. dollars. Upon his release, the captain covered his face with paper and did not respond to any reporters' questions. The captain's lawyer said his client is very sorry, but the captain denies being responsible for the collision. "I can say one thing, that he is incredibly affected by it. He is very sorry that this happened but this does not mean admitting criminal responsibility." The 64 year-old was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of criminal misconduct,  as his ship slammed into the side of the Hableany tourist boat,  causing it to capsize and rapidly sink to the bottom of the Danube River. The collision killed 25 people with three still missing. Under the conditions of his bail, the captain has to undergo police questioning twice a week and wear an electronic tracking device so he cannot leave Budapest. The search continues for the bodies of the missing. The Hungarian and Korean crews were not able to find any additional bodies during their search of the boat so they're planning to focus on scouring the Danube, particularly downstream from Budapest. Seoul's foreign ministry announced that the two sides will search the river with helicopters, drones, and boats  and deploy more than 60 people for the search. It also plans to seek cooperation from neighboring countries including Croatia, Romania and Serbia.

The Pohang Maritime Police Station (Chief Seong Dae-hoon, hereinafter referred to as the Pohang Coast Guard) is part of an active administration to spread a maritime safety culture and prevent coastal accidents such as drowning, with ‘Life jackets! Life vest!’ campaign was announced on the 17th. According to the Pohang Coast Guard, this campaign will be joined by the Korea Maritime Safety Association and the POSCO Technical Research Institute Volunteer Corps, which have agreed to prevent marine accidents at the Pohang Coast Guard Yeongilman Police Box ahead of the exponential increase in tourists during the holiday season and peak season after social distancing is lifted. On the 16th, from Yeongilman Beach to Hwajin Beach, the Yeongilman Police Station patrol car and 10 Marine Safety Association electric cars were used to march the vehicle, and it was well received by tourists visiting the sea. In addition, on April 22, the Yeongilman Port and Yonghan Natural Amusement Park area will carry out a campaign to wear life jackets in parallel with environmental cleanup activities such as collecting marine garbage with the POSCO Volunteer Corps. In addition, the Pohang Coast Guard produced and attached magnetic stickers for vehicles of 'life jacket = life jacket' to vehicles in their 20s, such as official vehicles and patrol cars, so that they could actively promote wearing life jackets in their daily lives as well as performing basic duties of the Coast Guard. I am running a brotherhood movement. Chief Seong Dae-hoon said, “I hope that this maritime safety campaign will be a good opportunity to learn safe water play habits by awakening the importance of wearing life jackets.”

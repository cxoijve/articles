[New Year’s Address] Taean County Governor Gasero Respected citizens!Leaving behind the eventful year of 2023, we welcome the hopeful new year of 2024, a leap forward toward the future.Thank you for your warm support over the past year, and I hope that in the new year, you will achieve great things in your work and that your family will always be blessed with health and happiness. Taean-gun achieved notable achievements in 2023 thanks to the power of its residents and the efforts of its public officials, despite difficult conditions.After three challenges, we finally secured a project cost of 26 billion won by attracting an urban regeneration contest in December, and in May, we were selected for a contest for 'creating a small-sized smart city' and secured 26.5 billion won, thereby renewing the downtown area of Taean-eup. We achieved the feat of securing a total of 50 billion won in financial resources for two projects.In addition, as the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission responded to the earnest petitions of 19,544 residents and the military's efforts, an adjustment was made to open Anheungjinseong Fortress, which had been confined in a military protection zone for 50 years, and an area of 742,198㎡ in Sakseon-ri, Taean-eup, which was a controlled protection zone, was established. There was also the joy of resolving long-standing wishes, such as downgrading the restricted protection zone and considering the complete lifting of the Baekhwasan military protection zone.In addition, the 'Additional Nutrition for the Elderly' project, which provides monthly vouchers of 100,000 won to residents over the age of 85, has been implemented since October, the construction of a new public mausoleum in Taean-gun has been completed, and the number of 19,024 units has been expanded, and a family complex community center and senior citizen center have been expanded. We also made every effort to improve the welfare of our residents, including taking the lead in building a care center.Amid these efforts, Taean-gun is preparing to open an era of happiness for its citizens by working together to secure 104.5 billion won in 2023, the largest amount since the military's restoration, through public offering projects.
Dear and respected citizens!In 2024, based on our achievements so far, we will continue our efforts for future development by focusing on fostering new industries and balanced development. For the next 100 years of Taean, we will apply for the target project for Chungcheongnam-do's ‘2nd Phase 2 Chungcheongnam-do Balanced Development Project’ through a city-county competitive contest and promote the construction of a ‘Marine Safety Drone Center’.In addition, with regard to the Taean-gun offshore wind power complex development project, we will create a path to secure groundbreaking tax revenues such as ‘creation of an integrated complex’ based on securing acceptance by residents, and we will strengthen the competitiveness of the Taean economy by taking the lead in nurturing the foundation of farming and fishing villages and recovering traditional market commercial districts.In addition, various projects to improve the quality of life of residents and create a tourism destination, such as the construction of the Gulf of California Marine Leisure Safety Education Center and the Nam-myeon Indoor Gymnasium, are being carried out without a hitch, and we are taking a step together with residents by steadily preparing for the '2026 Taean International Horticultural Healing Expo'. We will open 2024 with a new leap forward for further development.We ask for your warm affection and interest in the dynamic year of 2024 for Taean, which is developing into a hub city for the maritime economy in the Yellow Sea Rim. We once again hope that the families of our residents will be filled with love and happiness in the new year of 2024, the year of Gapjin. I sincerely wish you all the best.January 2024 Taean County Governor Gasero

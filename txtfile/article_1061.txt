Captain of Russian cargo ship that crashed into Busan's Gwangan Bridge taken into custody. The captain of the Russian cargo ship that smashed into the  Gwangan Bridge in Busan last Thursday has been taken into custody. The Coast Guard said the Busan District Court issued an arrest warrant,  fearing that he might flee. While he's accused of drunk sailing charges,  the captain insisted he drank after the crash and does not know why the collision occurred. The accident caused damage to the lower part of the bi-level bridge,  which will take a month to repair.

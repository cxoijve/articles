Hyundai Glovis, a logistics unit under Hyundai Motor Group, said on Tuesday it will apply digital training programs through ship handling simulators of its new subsidiary G-Marine to enhance operation and maintenance abilities of shipping crew. G-Marine Service acquired by Hyundai Glovis in July last year offers safety and maintenance services for ship owners, trains marine and shipping industry personnel, supervises shipbuilding work and sells vessel components. Hyundai Glovis has prioritized improving training services since its venture into ship operation and maintenance services with the acquisition last year. Such measures include the launch of G-Marine Academy to provide customized training programs to marine and shipping industry personnel and the introduction of a new ship handling simulator to better train professionals in ship performance over a range of maneuvering conditions including pre/post-accident handling scenarios. The company also decided to introduce six new training systems, including a dedicated simulator and a cargo securing trainer for operating members of its pure car and truck carrier (PCTCs). G-Marine Service will also be relocated to a larger site in Busan to meet requirements for business and organizational expansion.

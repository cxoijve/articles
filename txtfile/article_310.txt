Five municipalities adjacent to the Hanil Strait(Korea-japan), including Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongnam, Jeonnam, and Jeju, have launched a joint response to the ocean discharge of radioactive water contaminated with Fukushima.On the 22nd, the province held a working-level meeting on measures against ocean discharge of radioactive contaminated water in Fukushima in a conference room on the 18th floor of Busan City Hall on the 22nd, urged the Japanese government to withdraw its decision, shared the response situation for each province, and discussed joint countermeasures and cooperative tasks.These cities and provinces are geographically close to Japan and bordered by the Korea-Japan Strait, and are deeply concerned about the impact of this decision on the citizens' safety and marine environment as well as the fisheries industry, and continue to hold regular meetings in the future. It is a plan to respond.Busan Mayor Park Hyung-jun said, “Since the ocean discharge of radioactive contaminated water is a problem that is directly related to the health and safety of citizens as well as pollution of the marine environment, we will respond strongly through cooperation with cities and provinces adjacent to the Korea-Japan Strait, and protect the marine environment and manage the safety of seafood products. We will take all necessary measures for this.”In October of last year, five cities and provinces formed a working-level countermeasures council to prevent the ocean discharge of radioactive water contaminated in Fukushima, Japan, and prepared a joint proposal and delivered it to the Council of Mayors of the Republic of Korea.Accordingly, 17 Mayors and Do Governors adopted a joint proposal and on December 22 last year, they proposed to the government to immediately cease discussions on the ocean discharge of radioactive water contaminated with Fukushima.

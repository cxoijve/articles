South Korea’s shipbuilding conglomerate Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) Group and Hyundai Glovis, logistics unit under Hyundai Motor Group, joined hands to develop liquefied hydrogen carriers by combining HHI’s shipbuilding capability and Hyundai Glovis’ strengthen in transportation to preoccupy the market.HHI Group’s two shipbuilding units - Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE) and Hyundai Mipo Dockyard – announced Thursday that they received an approval in principle (AIP) to build a 20,000-square-meter liquefied hydrogen carrier under joint development of the shipyards and Hyundai Glovis from the Korean Register of Shipping and Liberia, the flag state of the ship.The vessel became the first large-sized liquefied hydrogen carrier in the world to receive the AIP and that can be put in commercial operation.Liquefaction is a necessary process to ship hydrogen because it reduces volume of the fuel and enhances safety. The cargo can be compressed to one-800th by liquefying hydrogen compared to its gaseous state, which makes it easier and safer to store and deliver. The vessel is equipped with vacuum-insulated tanks to minimize loss of hydrogen gas during transportation.KSOE has developed liquefied hydrogen processing system and evaporative gas processing system powered by fuel cells, while Hyundai Mipo Dockyard is in charge of ship design. Hyundai Glovis and G-Marine Service analyzed economic and safety aspects of shipping liquefied hydrogen.According to the Hydrogen Council, the hydrogen market is expected to grow to $2.5 trillion by 2050, representing 18 percent of global fuel demand.HHI Group official said it is meaningful that the shipbuilding and shipping companies joined forces for the first time to nurture next growth engines and they will keep tapping into broader countries with their outstanding technology.Hyundai Glovis said the joint development will help the companies build up transportation capability necessary to establish infrastructure for offshore hydrogen supply.

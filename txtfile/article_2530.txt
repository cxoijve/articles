Iran Wants Korea to Lift Freeze on Its FundsCCTV image of Hankuk Chemi and IRGC speedboatThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seized the Hankuk Chemi, a South Korean tanker, and this is said to be because of Iranian funds frozen in South Korea.“We are discussing measures related to payment of the funds to the COVAX Facility,” the South Korean government said on Jan. 5. The money, US$7 billion, is crude oil export proceeds and is currently at two South Korean banks after the United States strengthened its sanctions on Iran in 2018. The Iranian government has called for the South Korean government to lift the freeze.According to the South Korean government, the payment to the COVAX Facility is humanitarian and does not violate the sanctions. The Iran-Korea Chamber of Commerce proposed it to Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri on Jan. 2.The seizure occurred on Jan. 4 and the IRGC mentioned marine pollution as a cause. According to experts, however, this is to force Washington to return to the nuclear negotiating table and lift its sanctions. The South Korean government explained that its review related to the funds is irrelevant to and started before the seizure. Likewise, the Iranian government said that it is a purely technical measure following a court order for marine pollution investigations.Jung Suk-yeecontact@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

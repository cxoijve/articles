Yeosu Gwangyang Port Authority (YGPA) announced on the 19th that it had obtained the Ocean Bound Plastic (OBP) certification through Control Union, an international certification body.This certification is a renewal of the certification that YGPA acquired for the first time in Korea in 2021.In the meantime, many domestic institutions and companies have tried to acquire the second domestic marine plastic collection certification, but it was not possible to obtain the certification because it was difficult to establish a sustainable collection system and secure the traceability of marine plastics.The reason why companies are paying attention to marine plastic collection certification is that there is a lot of demand for marine plastic recycling products due to the recent ESG craze.Specifically, ▲ crackdown on plastic dumping of ships in cooperation with the Coast Guard ▲ collection and classification of marine plastic waste with Gwangyang Marine Environment Co., Ltd., a fluent cleaning company ▲ processing of marine waste plastics and production of recycled yarn with Hyosung TNC.With the marine plastic recycled yarn produced in this way, various bags from Plitzmama and T-shirts from The North Face have been released.In addition, YGPA produced safety vests with Songgwang Happy Town, a local social enterprise employing the disabled, and distributed them to small and medium-sized enterprises in the port.In particular, YGPA is contributing to the safety of port workers by manufacturing and installing lane control blocks from marine plastics, such as ship ropes and general plastics, which are less useful among marine plastics.The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries is promoting a policy to spread YGPA's marine plastics business model to ports nationwide, and YGPA is also consulting to spread the business model to other ports.President Park Seong-hyun said, “The marine plastics circular economy business is YGPA’s representative ESG management model. Meanwhile, the YGPA has been promoting the marine waste plastics circular economy project to realize social values such as protecting the marine environment and creating jobs.

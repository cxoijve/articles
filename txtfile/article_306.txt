In spring, outside activities are limited due to cold weather and high waves, but the number of tourists increases due to warm weather, and fishing boats are active in fishing, which is characterized by an increase in total maritime traffic.In particular, in spring, due to the relatively poor number of days of bad weather and poor registration conditions, it is time to pay special attention to the prevention of marine safety accidents.In the past three years, there have been a total of 731 ship accidents in the sea within the Yeosu Coastal Gyeongsang Province, and the number of marine leisure populations and passengers has steadily increased, and accidents by ship type include fishing boats (54.4%), fishing boats (14.8%), and leisure boats (11.0%). ), cargo ships (3.6%), and tugboats* (3.4%).By type of accident cause, the majority of accidents due to human factors are inadequate for safety due to poor maintenance (38.9%), negligence in operation (32.3%), negligence in management (15.3%), and bad weather (4.4%). Therefore, it was found that it was necessary to change the safety consciousness of the captain, ship workers, and marine leisure activists.Meanwhile, in March, a 29-ton anchovy fishing boat was placed on a reef in the coast of Songdo, Dolsan-eup, Yeosu-si, and a part of the vessel was submerged.The seven crew members on board in this accident were fortunately rescued, but the ship was severely damaged. As a result of the investigation of the cause of the accident, the ship sails in a low-depth, island-rich area at night, and the captain entrusts the sailing (steering gear) to a foreign sailor and is placed on a reef that has been temporarily absent. The bottom of the engine room is flooded with a wave hole, leading to great personal injury. It was a dizzying accident that could have been.We must never forget that this accident is also a representative safety insensitivity event, and vigilance can lead to an accident.As a result, Yeosu Coast Guard has been designated as a ``Agricultural Weapon Accident Frequent Sea Area'' that reflects recent accident statistics and meteorological analysis △V-PASS (fishing vessel location) in preparation for a sudden increase in marine accidents from March, where dense sea fog (agricultural weapons) is frequent △ △Providing marine safety information using various media such as transmission system) △Intensive management of vulnerable ships and multi-use ships △Operating a responsibility system for the security ship sector to prevent ``site-oriented'' maritime accidents △Immediately by strengthening cooperation with civil, government, and military rescue forces Preemptive accident prevention measures were established and implemented through the establishment of a rescue posture.First, as a result of a close analysis of the accident area for the last three years with the designation of the ``accident-prone sea area'' considering the characteristics of each sea area, a total of 5 locations (Gamak Bay, Geumo Island, and the nearby sea area) including Gamak Bay (the sea surrounded by Yeosu Peninsula and Dolsan Island, Jeollanam-do). In the vicinity of Sorido, Geogeumdo, and Baekdo), it is planned to reinforce accident response capacity by designating areas with frequent accidents of agricultural weapons and placing rescue forces in the center of a certain area. Second, in case of bad weather, V-PASS (fishing vessel location transmitter) is used to provide real-time weather information (agriculture occurrence, weather forecast, etc.), and low visibility for sailing vessels in non-controlled waters when ships are dispatched. )* The purpose of preemptive accident prevention activities is to maintain order in maritime traffic through related information and navigational safety broadcasts.Third, with intensive management of vulnerable ships and multi-use ships, safety management is reinforced through active control by implementing the ``preservation ship operation management warning system'' and ``coast safety accident risk forecast system'' for customized management by ship type.Fourth, by analyzing and dataizing the security situation in the area under the jurisdiction of the patrol vessel, the ``sector responsibility system'' is implemented to prevent maritime accidents in advance and for responsible security, and immediately use the data analyzed and data in the event of an accident and prevention activities in the jurisdiction. As a result, the guard ship is planning to actively cope with it.Fifth, by reinforcing cooperation with civil, government, and military rescue forces, an immediate rescue posture was established to discuss countermeasures against marine accidents of agricultural weapons in Yeosu, Goheung, and Gwangyang. The establishment of immediate structural posture is sometimes implemented through cooperation.Prior to these special countermeasures for marine accidents, vacationers and ship officials who visit the sea to prevent marine accidents say that changes in safety consciousness such as observing basic safety rules such as weather check, pre-departure inspection, thorough vigilance during operation, and wearing a life jacket are more important than anything else. I can say it.The Maritime Police will do their best to create a safe sea without maritime accidents by strengthening education and public relations activities to transform public safety consciousness to prevent safety accidents of sea families.In addition, do not lose laughter during difficult times due to Corona 19, and to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, we will always be with the marine police with the sea family until the day it becomes a daily routine again by keeping social distancing and observing quarantine rules.

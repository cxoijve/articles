N.K. denounces Seoul over ship collision

 North Korea Sunday accused the South Korean government of politically exploiting the recent collision of South and North Korean ships. "The South Korean authority should stop its attempt to exploit the marine accident politically," Radio Pyongyang quoted a spokesman at the so-called Myohyang Shipping Co. (MSC) in the North as saying in a statement. MSC owns the North Korean freighter which sank after colliding with a Hyundai container ship from South Korea in the Indian Ocean last Wednesday. The accusation is Pyongyang's first reaction to the crash, the first of its kind between South and North Korea since the division of Korea in 1945.The accident left 37 North Korean crew aboard the 7,000-ton "Manpok-ho" missing. The two remaining North Korean seamen were rescued by crew members of the 52,000-ton "Hyundai Duke," and handed over to North Korean diplomats in Sri Lanka. "But three South Koreans, including two diplomats, blocked our shipping officials from getting on board the Hyundai container ship to find out the cause of the accident and taking back the rescued crewmen," the MSC spokesman claimed. The North stressed that the two Koreas should settle the vessel collision accident "smoothly" without intervention by governments or a third party. "For the accident took place between civic vessels, it is most reasonable for those directly concerned to settle the problem on the basis of brotherly love and humanitarianism," the MSC spokesman said. The North, which claimed the South Korean media portrayed the accident as solely the fault of the North Korean vessel, blamed the Hyundai ship for the crash. "The fact that the Hyundai Duke was slightly damaged while our Manpok-ho sank immediately shows the collision was the South Korean ship's fault," the North said.

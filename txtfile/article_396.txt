On the 9th, POSCO announced that it had transferred the sea forest created in Namyangri, Ulleungdo to Ulleung-gun.As the sea forest that POSCO created in Namyang-ri, Ulleung-gun three years ago produced tangible results, such as seaweeds growing luxuriantly and young fish crowded, the sea forest was transferred to Ulleung-gun, the local government in charge. To commemorate Sea Arbor Day, which was designated as May 10, the decision was made to relocate ahead of that date.About 20 people attended the ceremony, including the mayor of Ulleung-gun in the South Korean region, Lee Hee-geun, head of POSCO's Safety and Environment Headquarters, Koh Dong-joon, head of the Environment and Energy Research Center at the Pohang Institute of Industrial Science (RIST), as well as the Fisheries Resources Research Institute of Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, Namyang-ri fishing village chief and fishermen.At the event, the results of the sea forest creation project were highlighted, and 30,000 juveniles of the kingfisher, sponsored by the Gyeongsangbuk-do Fisheries Resources Research Institute, were released to the sea forest site. The fry released on this day were produced by the Gyeongsangbuk-do Fisheries Resources Research Institute to recover fish resources and preserve the ecosystem, and healthy seeds were selected and provided after an infectious disease test.
Lee Hee-geun, head of POSCO's safety and environment division, said, "POSCO will continue to cooperate by utilizing our technology in a way that can contribute to the local community as a corporate citizen."The mayor of Ulleung-gun in South Korea said, “It gives me strength because POSCO is interested in the whitening of the sea and the decrease in fishery resources in Ulleungdo’s sea and is working to restore the ecosystem.” We hope that regional cooperation projects will continue,” he said.In May 2020, POSCO installed 100 Triton* artificial reefs and 750 Triton blocks underwater in the offing of Namyang-ri, southern Ulleungdo, creating a sea forest of about 0.4 ha. 100 Tritons are installed at the edge of the sea forest to grow algae, and 750 Triton blocks are piled up like a mountain in the center to serve as habitats and spawning grounds for fish.For the past three years, POSCO has been managing the sea forest with special attention, including regular ecological monitoring and seaweed transplantation. In September 2020, due to the super typhoons 'Mysak' and 'Hiseon' that hit Ulleungdo in succession, most of the algae transplanted to the artificial reefs suffered great damage, such as dropping off. After making efforts to restore the area, such as test application, in March of this year, it succeeded in creating a sea forest with 100% algae coverage.In particular, through the creation of the sea forest in Ulleungdo, the biomass of seaweeds such as Ecklonia and japonica in the Namyangri sea forest increased more than 40 times compared to the initial period of creation, and the number of seaweed species increased from the initial 10 species to more than 18 species. In addition, numerous schools of fish such as stone bream, bream, and rockfish are inhabiting, showing a variety of ecological restoration effects.Steel slag, the main material of Triton used by POSCO in sea forests, has a higher content of minerals such as calcium and iron, which are useful for the marine ecosystem, than general aggregates, and has the effect of promoting algae growth and photosynthesis. It not only restores fishery resources in the damaged marine ecosystem in a short period of time, but also contributes to the preservation of biodiversity.Meanwhile, in recognition of POSCO’s efforts to protect the marine ecosystem through the creation of the Triton sea forest, on April 30, at the International Corporate Citizenship Conference (ICCC) held by the Boston College affiliated Corporate Citizenship Research Center, POSCO For the first time, it was selected as the recipient of the Eco-Innovator award.In the future, POSCO plans to promote the restoration of the marine ecosystem and increase the income of fishermen through activities such as creating sea forests using Triton and developing eco-friendly sea fertilizer using steel slag.

As citizen anxiety about marine products grows due to the discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the city first collects samples once a week from companies that supply food ingredients to local daycare centers and requests testing from the Gyeonggi Provincial Health and Environment Research Institute.On the 30th of last month, samples of four types of seafood and processed marine products were collected from two food ingredient companies and requested testing from the Gyeonggi Provincial Health and Environment Research Institute.The city also conducts a joint special inspection of 20 types of products subject to mandatory country of origin labeling in conjunction with the country of origin honorary watchdog, which consists of 11 citizens.In an inspection conducted from the 1st to the 31st of last month targeting 43 medium and large sales establishments and 200 restaurants handling marine products, no violations were found. Previously, a special inspection conducted for two months from May to June showed that the country of origin labeling obligations were well observed. On this day, the city again began inspections of 282 mid-sized and large-sized stores and restaurants handling seafood.The city is also operating a ‘Citizen Radiation Testing Claim System’ to relieve citizens’ anxiety about radioactive contamination of food. Citizens, group cafeterias, civic groups, etc. can request inspection of agricultural and marine products or processed products from food sellers. The city visits the desired collection stores listed on the application, collects the reported food, and requests a radioactivity test from the Gyeonggi Provincial Health and Environment Research Institute.As of the 1st, radiation safety tests have been conducted on a total of 72 cases, including 42 processed foods, 22 marine products, and 8 agricultural products. As a result of the test, both ‘iodine 131’ and ‘cesium 134+137’, which are the standards notified by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, were found to be below the radioactivity safety standard (100Bq/Kg) and were confirmed to be safe.A city official said, “Citizens’ anxiety about seafood is growing due to the decision to discharge contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan,” and added, “We will do our best to minimize citizens’ concerns and ensure thorough food safety so that they can eat seafood with confidence.” said.

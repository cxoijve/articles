The world's leading innovation technology expo 'CES 2024' is only 10 days awayWill the leading Korean VR education company, MetaEduSys, reveal its true potentials?[내외경제TV] 주현웅 기자='CES 2024', where technology companies from around the world showcase their latest technologies and explore new business opportunities, will be held for a total of four days from January 9th to 12th, starting with the beginning of 2024.At this event, where global companies compete to show off their products in home appliances and information tecchnology(IT), there will be large-scale promotions of innovative technologies in various fields, including Metaverse and Artificial Intelligence(AI), which have been leading the global technology industry over the past few years.The wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, USA, which swept through 2023 sending shockwaves throughout the world, destroyed more than 2,700 buildings and caused property damage of approximately $6 billion, while the wildfires in British Columbia, western Canada, covered an area of 137,000㎢, making it a global disaster.Such deadly disasters were not spared in Europe either. Greece, Spain, Italy, and Cyprus also suffered greatly from large wildfires.There is news that an educational VR solution for the purpose of raising awareness of the dangers of large wildfires, which is a global issue that has attracted the attention of people around the world, and actively addressing environmental issues worldwide, will be exhibited at CES 2024, Las Vegas.South Korea's startup, MetaEduSys Co., Ltd.(CEO Jong-hee Bae) will exhibit a VR software product called "VR Wildfire Education". This disaster safety VR software, proceeding in an "open world" manner with a wildfire situation in the background, is an educational solution that shows how to respond when a wildfire occurs andIn addition, a device with a flexible thermoelectric element to which the 'ThermoReal' technology is applied and freely expresses heat and cold sensations allows users to have a more realistic and immersive experience. This may be a technology that is not easily expected from a startup.However, the company is already well-known in the VR educational content industry in Korea, and this CES participation is already the second time following last year. Founded in 2017, MetaEduSys, has developed a number of VR software programs on disaster safety education that have been proven to have excellent quality in software evaluations including Grade 1 in GS Certification in Korea, starting with Korea's first interactive survival swimming VR educational software, 'Survival Swimming VR', and 'Ship Accident VR', 'Fire Prevention VR', 'Maritime Safety VR', and 'Carbon Neutrality VR'. At 'CES 2023' the company introduced 2 types of VR software for teaching how to cope with disasters like fires and ship accidents. This year, in addition to this, a new VR solution on wildfires will be presented.MetaEduSys, which is already widely known throughout South Korea for its disaster experiential educational VR software designed for effective education, has been introducing the VR education software and content at various events, and at 'CES 2024', they will meet with global visitors through their 'Disaster Experience VR' series. At this event, global giants such as Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics of Korea will showcase their technological prowess, and this small startup will also show off its own technological prowess before the global audience, which cannot be looked down.Jong-hee Bae, CEO, who hopes this event to be an opportunity for the company's products to be known worldwide, said, "We have already been recognized for our technological prowess in a number of disaster safety VR educational solutions domestically, and now we want to enter the global market and convey our message using VR software as a medium to people around the world. Using our technology and commercially viable products, we also want to collectively ponder on the fundamental question of 'safety', a problem faced by the world and humanity as a whole."MetaEduSys is a small company in South Korea, a small country on the outskirts of the world, but it will use opportunities like CES 2024 as a stepping stone to achieve its goal of entering the global market. Not only the new technologies by Apple and Meta, but also the world market attack of 'K-Software' made by this small Korean company should be watched closely.주현웅 기자today@nbntv.co.kr다른기사 보기저작권자 © 내외경제TV 무단전재 및 재배포 금지

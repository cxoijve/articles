Gyeongbuk-do, fully committed to ensuring food safety for residents. The Gyeongsangbuk-do Health and Environment Research Institute disclosed the results of safety tests on over 2,800 distributed agricultural and marine products conducted throughout 2023.According to the Institute of Health and Environment on the 2nd, a total of 1,807 agricultural and marine products brought into the wholesale markets in Andong, Gumi, and Pohang were tested for hazardous substances such as pesticide residues, and 15 cases, including chives, were found to be nonconforming. The results were notified to the relevant organizations and the nonconforming agricultural and marine products Measures were taken to prevent it from being distributed.In addition, as a result of testing for hazardous substances in 335 agricultural and marine products requested by the city and county, one case of Schisandra chinensis was found to be nonconforming, and the requesting agency was promptly notified to take action.In 2023, as the entire public was very concerned about radioactive contamination of food due to the discharge of contaminated treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the research institute strengthened radioactivity testing to relieve residents' anxiety and minimize economic damage.In addition to daycare centers and schools that are currently conducting radioactivity tests on meal ingredients, we also expanded the testing to social welfare facilities to ensure the safety of meal ingredients for all classes sensitive to radiation. As there were concerns about a decline in consumption of seafood, we jointly conducted radioactivity tests on market specialty products and highly consumed seafood in collaboration with the Merchants' Association of fisheries markets located on the east coast of Gyeongbuk, and provided data (reports, QR codes) to promote the safety of seafood. In addition, as a result of conducting a radioactivity test on 663 distributed foods, including meal ingredients and marine products from major fish markets, it was confirmed that all foods were safe from radioactive substances. An official from the Gyeongbuk Institute of Health and Environment announced that in 2024, they plan to strengthen the inspection of existing gamma nuclides such as iodine and cesium, and at the same time establish an additional inspection system for nuclides that are not filtered out by purification facilities, such as tritium.Lee Chang-il, head of the food and drug research department at the Gyeongbuk Health and Environment Research Institute, said, “We will continue to do our best to protect the food safety of the residents through rapid and accurate analysis of hazardous substances in agricultural and marine products.”

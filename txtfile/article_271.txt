Fishing equipment “More than 15 tons of fishery products manufactured and produced in 8 prefectures, including Fukushima, and processed products served on people’s tables...”Import of seafood from 8 prefectures, including Fukushima, is banned. Processed seafood products are allowed.Processed seafood products manufactured and produced in Fukushima alone amount to nearly 9 tons.Despite the ban on imports of seafood from eight prefectures, including Fukushima, imports of processed seafood products manufactured and produced in eight prefectures, including Fukushima, were found to exceed 15 tons between July and September of this year (as of September 18).As a result of an analysis of the radioactivity testing status of imported foods by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the Secretary of the Democratic Party of Korea and the Democratic Party of Korea's Fisheries Committee of the National Assembly's Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee (Dangjin City, South Chungcheong Province) analyzed the status of radioactivity tests on imported foods from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, and found that fishery products manufactured in eight prefectures, including Fukushima, Japan, where imports of marine products have been banned since 2013. Processed marine products such as fish shells and fish cakes were still being served on people's tables.Among the processed seafood products imported from eight prefectures, including Fukushima, over the past three months, products manufactured and produced in Fukushima Prefecture, the area of the nuclear power plant accident, accounted for the largest amount at 8.9 tons, while products manufactured and produced in Miyagi Prefecture, located just above Fukushima, accounted for 4.5 tons. followed.In the case of processed seafood products, they are not specified in the items subject to the Korean government's import ban. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety explains that in the case of processed food, it conducts radioactivity tests for each case and requests an additional nuclide certificate if even a trace amount is detected, and is establishing a system in which if there is a problem, it is virtually prohibited from being imported. However, if marine products caught off the coast of Fukushima are made into fish fillets or cooked with seasoning additives, they can avoid the import ban by our government and be placed on people's tables.Moreover, as the Japan Trade Promotion Organization (JETRO), which began developing sales channels for marine products at the request of the Japanese government on the 11th, hinted at expanding seafood exports to Korea, the food anxiety that has grown since the discharge of contaminated water is expected to intensify.Fishing Organization lawmaker: “Measures are needed to alleviate people’s food anxiety”Rep. Eogyu said, “It is difficult to understand that the import of marine products is prohibited, but there are no problems with products made by processing them,” and emphasized, “Measures against indirect exports through processed products are needed to relieve people’s food anxiety.”

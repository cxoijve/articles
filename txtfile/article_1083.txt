Two bodies found from ship wreck in Yellow Sea. South Korea's Coast Guard on Saturday recovered the bodies of two dead crew members of a fishing boat that sank in the Yellow Sea while returning from a search for clues to last week's naval disaster, Yonhap News reported.The bodies of 55-year-old South Korean Kim Jong-pyong and 35-year-old Indonesian Yusuf Haaefa were found at around 10 a.m. and 7:15 p.m., respectively, in waters southwest of Daecheong Island, according to the Incheon Coast Guard.The two were part of a nine-member crew of the 99-ton Kumyang 98 fishing boat that sank late Friday. The fate of the seven other crew, including another Indonesian national, was still unknown.The Kumyang 98 was employed by authorities to help search for evidence that could shed light on why the 1,200-ton Navy corvette Cheonan sank on March 26 near the maritime border with North Korea.The Taiyo-1 -- a Cambodian-registered freighter -- has been detained by authorities in relation to the sinking of the South Korean fishing boat.The 1,472 ton freighter was intercepted at 2 a.m. Saturday and escorted to Daecheong Island, where authorities were to question the crew and check the ship. Reports indicate that there were signs of a collision on the starboard side of the forward hull. "The captain did not admit to a collision, but conceded he felt some kind of impact," a South Korean officer said. He added that an underwater search will be carried out to see if there are other signs of a collision.

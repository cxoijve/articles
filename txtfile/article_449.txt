Gyeonggi Province will conduct joint provincial-city and county crackdowns on the use of inorganic acids and unlicensed laver farming practices at laver farms in the province for five months from the 13th to April 30th of next year. .Inorganic acid is an illegal substance used to remove foreign substances from seaweed farms. It has a chlorine ion concentration of 30-33% and is highly acidic to organic acids (less than 9.5%). The use of inorganic acids classified as hazardous chemicals in seaweed farms is prohibited by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries because it can damage marine environmental pollution and the safety of marine products.The target of this crackdown is 66 laver harvesting farms, including 48 in Hwaseong-si and 18 in Ansan-si, with 3,100ha.The main contents of the crackdown include ▲ (on land) illegal storage and loading of inorganic acids near ports and ports ▲ (marine) whether or not harmful chemicals are loaded or used in fishing grounds management boats that are collecting seaweed.On land, the docks, warehouses, and plastic greenhouses near ports and ports (Ansan Tando/Haengnanggok, Hwaseong Jebu Gungpyeong Port, etc.) near the laver farm, which are likely to store inorganic acids, are intensively inspected. At sea, three fishing guidance ships from Provincial, Ansan, and Hwaseong will be used to strengthen inspections and searches for seaweed harvesting and aquaculture sites and fishing ground management vessels.According to the current Fisheries Resources Management Act, the storage or use of hazardous chemical substances (inorganic acids) for the purpose of use in seaweed farms is strictly restricted. Administrative measures such as suspension or cancellation will also be imposed.In order to curb the illegal use of inorganic acids in the provincial laver farms, we invest more than KRW 600 million every year to provide active treatment agents (organic acids) with a chlorine ion concentration of 9.5% or less that are suitable for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries’ standards for use of active agents to laver farms in Ansan and Hwaseong. are doing“We will establish a fair fishery order by strictly punishing any acts that destroy the marine environment and cause distrust in Gyeonggi laver products due to the use of inorganic acids,” said the head of the Gyeonggi Ocean and Fisheries Division.Meanwhile, the provincial government has found a total of six cases of illegal use of inorganic acids over the past three years and has taken measures such as judicial disposition.

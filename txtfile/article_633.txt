Pohang Marine Police Station (Chief Seong Dae-hoon) announced on the 19th that it conducted an unidentified ship infiltration training to establish a coastal alert posture at the end of the year.This training was conducted as a joint exercise by relevant agencies, with the participation of the National Intelligence Service, the 1st Marine Division, and the ROK Armed Forces Counterintelligence Unit, assuming a situation where an unidentified ship was approaching land in the sea near Guryongpo.There is a recent case where the Coast Guard and the military cooperated to quickly block security threats in the event of Chinese illegal immigration into Boryeong or North Korean defection to Sokcho. Since this is a situation that could occur in Pohang, we worked with related organizations to increase response capabilities.Chief Seong Dae-hoon said, “Through this joint training, we inspected the maritime security and safety status in the Pohang area, where national important facilities are scattered,” and added, “We will continue to maintain a thorough coastal alert posture through thorough cooperation with each agency.”Meanwhile, the Pohang Coast Guard rescued a submerged ship in cooperation with a private marine rescue ship that day.Yeongil Bay Police Station, which received a report that the engine room of fishing boat A (9-ton class, 3 people) was flooded in the sea about 4km east of Chilpo at around 10:16 a.m., immediately dispatched a coastal rescue boat and rescued private marine rescue vessel B operating nearby. 24 tons, 4 people) were also requested to cooperate.When the Yeongilman Police Station coastal rescue boat arrived, Captain C (male, 60s) of Ship A said, “I don’t know when the engine will turn off because the engine room is full of water. “She asked for a courtesy call.”She attached the rope and started towing. However, she was unable to withstand the weight of the 9-ton fishing boat and the line broke. Fortunately, private marine rescue vessel B arrived at the scene immediately and towed A while moored to the left of B's hull and entered Yonghan Port.After entering the port, drainage work was carried out using a total of three units, including the Yeongil Bay Police Station and the private marine rescue ship B, as well as the pumps owned by the 108 boats that arrived later. The water gradually decreased and A regained her stability.Mr. C, the captain of Ship A, said, “After the drainage was completed, I looked into the engine room and it seemed like the coolant pipes were damaged and seawater came in.”

Seadronics is emerging as a promising startup that will lead to innovation in the shipping industry. It is expected to enter into MOUs with major domestic and foreign shipping companies through artificial intelligence (AI)-based port and ship control solutions.According to the venture industry on the 7th, Seadronics was recently selected as Asia's first accelerating program "Waypoint" under Lloyd's shipping in the UK.WayPoint is an acceleration program that supports marine innovative technology companies to enter the global market and introduce solutions on-site. With this selection, Seedronics will be recognized for its marine object and environmental recognition artificial intelligence technology and sensor convergence technology.Seadronics is currently developing AI technologies needed for ports and ships, aiming to operate ships autonomously. Representative technologies include "AVISS," an AI port management monitoring system, and "NAVISS," an AI operation support monitoring system.AVISS automatically analyzes the surrounding environment of ships docked at ports with AI and provides real-time situation information to controllers and ship managers. It also provides various data to assist the port operation from the entry of the ship to the time of departure.NAVISS provides around-view images to captains and crew members through sensor modules installed on ships. Based on the provided video, ship members can grasp the surrounding situation in real time and operate safely in areas with a high risk of collision, such as port waters and narrow channels.jinyong leeebskincafe@hanmail.netView More ArticleCopyright Â© SmartTimes.

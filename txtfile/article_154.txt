More than three-fourths of South Koreans have sharply reduced their consumption of marine products over safety concerns since August when highly radioactive water was found to be leaking from a storage tank into the ground at the Fukushima nuclear plant in northeastern Japan, a survey said Monday. According to the online poll of 661 people conducted by the Korea Rural Economic Institute from Oct. 18 to Oct. 20, 521 respondents or 77.5 percent of those interviewed said they curtailed their consumption of marine products by nearly half - 48.9 percent. About 19.5 percent of respondents said the amount of marine products they ate remained unchanged, the survey. Only one pollee replied that he or she ate more marine products, it said. Fukushima was the worldâ€™s second most disastrous incident after Chernobyl which occurred in 1986.

In August, drones came to the forefront as convenience stores in Korea started pilot testing drone delivery to remote areas. However, this is just the beginning, as the Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) is conducting demonstration projects to expand the use of drones in Korea.Drones are being tested for transporting emergency medical supplies in the 2022 K-drone system demonstration project conducted by the Ministry of Land and Infrastructure and Transport.

Alternatively, blood, organs for transplant, first aid kits and vaccine can be safely delivered to remote mountainous areas reducing the complicated cold chain requirements. Furthermore, drones can also be applied to disaster relief in high-risk environments with chemical or biological hazards to enable healthcare related rescue operations.Another potential application is an unobstructed ambulance service with video and communication which can instruct human bystanders in emergency situations to perform CPR, use the automated defibrillator (AED) or use the drone to fetch necessary medicines from nearby pharmacies until the ambulance arrives.This is the promise that drones can deliver.With the goal of commercialization of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) in Seoul by 2025 and everyday use of modern transport platforms by 2030, it seems like the right time for industries to show interest. Drones are also viewed as a more sustainable option and way to reduce carbon as stated by the World Economic Forum (WEF).As nice as this sounds, the drone field is still highly regulated as it has to share the sky with airplanes, helicopters and more. Even retail giants like Amazon have showcased failures in this area. Some of the most major concerns for drones include collision accidents, hacking and safety issues regarding radio wave interference.Benchmarking successful drone systemsDeveloped countries including Korea has a better healthcare infrastructure with advanced technologies but developing countries lack access to medical care.GAVI, an international organization for improving access to new and underused vaccines, and Zipline, a leading drone manufacturer and operator, is one example of institutions that have successfully bridged this gap.This was first demonstrated in Rwanda in 2016 and subsequently expanded in Ghana for vaccine delivery in 2021. Zipline have also successfully delivered Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccines in the first long-range drone delivery. More recently, Zipline partnered with Walmart to provide over the counter (OTC) drugs, with MultiCare Health System to supply lab samples, medications, and test kits and earlier this month, they launched the delivery of prescription medicines with Intermountain Healthcare.On the other hand, the U.K.’s Skyway, a 165-mile drone superhighway, aims to create an automated space to reduce the work of managing all unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while also removing the risks of individual operator collisions. It is estimated to cost $14.2 million (20.2 billion won) and will use a series of high-powered, ground-based sensors which will interface to centrally direct all overhead traffic. Consequently, U.K. drone operators can forgo equipping drones with navigational sensors to maximize UAVs payload, range, and efficiency.Comparatively, Korea is also trying to achieve something similar. Korea Airports Corporation (KAC) and Hancom inSpace were selected by the Land Ministry to demonstrate an optimized 'drone road' that resolved communication and physical obstacles and identify collision prevention functions of multiple drones in the city center of Seoul at an estimated cost of 268 million won.The image demonstrates the necessary infrastructure for drone implementation in Korea including different flying heights for each category of urban air mobility (UAM), an unmanned traffic management (UTM) center, remote IDs for each UAM, an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operator and geofencing to create a no-fly zone.

In the medical industry, the Korean Red Cross located in the North Chungcheong Province and a nearby hospital were selected to demonstrate the feasibility of emergency medical supplies like emergency antidotes and blood delivery with drones.Additionally, Pablo Airlines, a Korean drone start-up which enables urgent deliveries of medicines and relief good to islands and remote areas in Korea, will team up with Incheon International Airport Corporation to verify the demonstration of long-distance maritime emergency medicine delivery.However, to date, there have been no cases of blood delivery so far, said a MOLIT official.He noted that the government is practicing flight for this delivery which is expected to be conducted in November. Subsequently, these results will help inform MOLIT’s basic plan guidelines for the development of the drone industry scheduled to be released in the first half of 2023.South Korea’s drone market is expected to double from 372.6 million in 2020 to 602.9 million in 2024, according to the MOLIT. Korea appears to be approaching commercialization as the MOLIT started conducting “performance test reports.”Accordingly, Minister Won emphasized safety."For UAM to become a public mode of transport, it should be safe, convenient and affordable. We will also try to minimize the risks of commercialization in the beginning by collaborating with local institutions and experts,” he went on to say.Drone regulations required for successKorea can learn from well-established drone companies like American-based Zipline which have already recorded many successful drone deliveries of medical supplies, getting required approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In this regard, the FDA seems to be taking a hands-off approach unless the drone itself is used as a medical device like drones equipped with telemedicine or AI-trained medical services. Accordingly, drone manufacturers need to consult with the relevant agencies like the FDA, the FTC, and other federal or state agencies to regulate drone technology.Asked what improvements were needed for Korea’s medical drone industry, an official from MOLIT said, “Technology development, transportation system construction, safety verification, and expansion of the delivery industry are all currently being reviewed through the drone demonstration projects which are expected to help the industrialization of drones in Korea.”​As a highly regulated field, commercialization in the medical industry could pave the way for other industries to also achieve drone commercialization in Korea. Drones were first characterized by their small shape and ability to provide a unique bird’s eye perspectives but have come a long way although it still faces regulations in the medical field.Industry watchers are paying keen attention to whether Korea’s strong bio-industry could help push the commercialization of the drone industry.tweetRelated articlesExperts' views vary on ‘how’ Korea should implement telemedicineMarianne Changmchang@docdocdoc.co.krSee Other ArticlesCopyright © KBR Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution prohibited

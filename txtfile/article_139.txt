Taean Coast Guard asks to be careful about coastal activities during the Daejo period. 
Taean Marine Police Station announced on the 10th that it would issue the ‘Safety Accident Risk Forecast System’ advisory level for four days from the 11th to the 14th.
This measure by the Taean Coast Guard is because there is a high possibility of coastal accidents occurring during the contrast period, when the difference between tides and tides increases as the Earth and the Moon get closer. According to the Taean Coast Guard, there were 60 coastal accidents that occurred last year, and 41 of them (69%) were caused by failure to recognize the tide caused by the difference in tides. In order to prevent coastal accidents during the contrast period, the Taean Coast Guard used the disaster prediction and warning system to provide advance safety guidance such as tidal warnings and prohibition of parking in low-lying areas, strengthened patrols in areas with frequent isolation according to tidal times, and took measures to move mudflat activities to safe areas. We plan to strengthen prevention activities. An official from the Taean Coast Guard said, “During the high tide period, the difference between tidal and tidal waves is large and the speed of water coming in is fast, so for safe coastal activities, do not park vehicles in low-lying areas, and set a tide alarm in advance when entering isolated areas such as Chicken Island and Grandfather Rock. “Individuals must follow safety rules, such as always wearing a life jacket when engaging in coastal activities such as fishing or tidal flat experiences, working with two or more people when experiencing tidal flats, and moving to land after low tide,” he said.

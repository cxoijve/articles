Japan has asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address Korea's ban on imports of Japanese fisheries products, the government said Thursday.In a joint statement of related ministries and the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, the government expressed regret over Tokyo's request to the WTO to intervene in Seoul's measure that were taken in September 2013.The government imposed a ban on all fisheries products from Fukushima and seven surrounding prefectures amid fears over their safety in the wake of a nuclear accident in 2011."We regret the move as we were considering whether to ease the ban to some extent," it said in a press release.Under WTO rules on dispute settlement, consultations are the first step in working out a trade dispute, with talks to begin within 30 days of the request being filed.If no agreement is reached within 60 days of the filing, the complainant can ask for the establishment of a dispute settlement panel. "During consultations, we'll fully explain to Japan that we took the measure for health and safety reasons," the government said.

This week, three Chinese ships join an international task force operating in the Gulf of Aden to protect shipping from attacks by Somali pirates, marking the first time since the 15th century that Chinese vessels have sailed so far from home.This reflects a marked strengthening of Chinese military capabilities since the country shifted its focus three decades ago from supporting revolutionary movements around the world to the development of its economy.The decision to send this flotilla ― two destroyers and a supply ship ― could not have been taken lightly. China knew that political analysts around the world would study the implications of this move.On one hand, China had been accused of being a free rider, relying on Washington to keep open sea lanes for China-bound ships carrying oil and other cargo from Africa and the Middle East.The United States has exhorted China to be a ``responsible stakeholder'' and the Chinese, in explaining their decision to send warships off to Africa, have explained that they are simply discharging their responsibility.The Chinese decision was announced after a resolution by the United Nations Security Council authorizing international forces to combat piracy and, indeed, to pursue pirates on land.China has long had a policy of noninterference in other countries' internal affairs, and its participation in anti-piracy efforts does not violate that principle because the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia has welcomed participation of the Chinese navy.But China knew that by sending this naval force it would demonstrate its ability to project power far beyond its shores and revive fears of a ``China threat.'' That is why Beijing is trying its best to look unthreatening and depicting its action as that of a responsible power.In the end, Beijing really had no choice. In the last year, seven cases of hijacking by Somali pirates involved China, either because the ships were owned by China or had Chinese crews. In fact, one Chinese ship with a crew of 18 is still being held hostage by Somali pirates.The day before Beijing disclosed its decision a Chinese ship was attacked by pirates, though the attempt was thwarted by Malaysian naval forces. It would be difficult for China to explain why tiny Malaysia could contribute forces to protect international shipping when a large country like China remained passive.Major countries, such as the United States, the European Union, Russia and India are already involved. Since China is a permanent member of the Security Council, it could well have been accused of shirking its responsibility if it were to remain uninvolved.Liu Jianchao, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, explained, that the purpose of the Chinese mission ``is to ensure the safety of Chinese ships and personnel on the route and protect vessels of international organizations carrying humanitarian materials.''This is a rather narrow definition. After all, if Malaysia can help a Chinese ship under attack, there is no reason why Chinese forces should not be deployed to assist non-Chinese ships.It is very likely that once the Chinese ships begin their patrols, they will find it advantageous to coordinate their actions with warships from other countries, all of whom are out to counter piracy on the high seas.This in itself would be a positive development since it would in effect revive a military-to-military dialogue with the United States that China suspended to protest arms sales to Taiwan.While Washington has welcomed China's contribution to the anti-piracy effort, there are undoubtedly mixed feelings as well, as China moves slowly from a coastal navy to a blue-water navy. The United States has little to fear at present, but competition from China will increase.The same week that China announced the dispatch of warships to Africa, its Defense Ministry confirmed that it was giving serious consideration to building aircraft carriers.The spokesman quickly added that China ``has a long coastline and the sacred duty of China's armed forces is to safeguard the country's marine safety and sovereignty over coastal areas and territorial seas.''Given the Taiwan context, the United States has to consider the implications of China's rise as a naval power. Similarly, Japan, which has disputes with China over energy resources in the East China Sea, cannot afford to be complacent.But the bottom line is that China is now not only integrated into the world economy, it is integrated into all aspects of global life. Protecting its shipping is part and parcel of China's emergence and its participation in the new world order.

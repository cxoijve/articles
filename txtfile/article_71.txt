Incheon Marine Police Station announced that it had issued a ‘attention’ safety accident risk forecast system from the 13th to the 16th. According to the Incheon Coast Guard, the sea level is higher than usual, which increases the possibility of accidents, so special caution is needed, especially when engaging in mudflat activities. Incheon Coast Guard is strengthening land and sea patrols according to tidal times and maintaining emergency response readiness to prepare for coastal accidents such as tidal flat isolation. An Incheon Coast Guard official said, “As the weather gets colder, the sea surface temperature decreases, which could lead to a fatal accident in the event of a marine accident.” He added, “During coastal activities, marine safety rules such as prohibiting entry into dangerous areas, wearing life jackets, and checking the tide must be observed. “Do it,” he urged. Meanwhile, by downloading and using apps such as ‘Sea Navi’, ‘Harrod’, and ‘Safe Sea’, you can obtain various marine safety information such as tide tables.

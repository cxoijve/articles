Jeonbuk Buan Coast Guard set up a special period to prevent maritime accidents and strengthened safety measures during the agricultural season, when thick fog frequently occurs.The Buan Coast Guard said, "Prepare for the characteristics of the marine environment where thick fog (dense fog) often occurs on the sea by July, while preemptively managing safety in accident-prone sea areas through data analysis and strengthening the cooperation system with related organizations. We start to prevent," he said on the 9th.According to the Korea Coast Guard, a whopping 36.7%(102 cases) of a total of 282 maritime ship accidents in the West Sea over the past three years occurred mainly in March and July, the agricultural season.By ship type, fishing boats accounted for the most with 53%(54 vessels), followed by leisure vessels with 29.5%(26 vessels) and fishing boats with 4%(4 vessels). ) ▲ Human factors such as negligence(20.5%) accounted for 79.2%.In particular, in March, fishing boats that have stopped operating throughout the winter start operations in earnest, and with the number of tourists visiting the beach in the spring season increasing, the risk of marine accidents such as vessel collision, loss of direction, and isolation is high.Accordingly, ▲ Gyeokpo Port ▲ Imsu Island ▲ Miyeodo ~ Mohang ▲ Wido (Esophageal Island) ▲ Hyeongjedo Island are designated as 'Sea Areas with Frequent Agricultural Weapon Accidents' Manage and develop customized preventive activities.In addition, based on the results of analyzing the causes of accidents, such as providing maritime safety information to prevent accidents to maritime workers, publicity activities to enhance safety awareness are also carried out at the same time.In addition, information is exchanged between the civil, government, and military rescue forces to strengthen response posture, and the 'Regional Marine Search and Rescue Technical Committee' will be held on the 17th to establish a cooperative system for preventing agricultural weapons accidents among related organizations such as local governments, fire departments, and fisheries cooperatives. also build.In addition, it is a policy to flexibly deploy and operate security forces in areas of concern for accidents according to public security demand for intensive safety management by type of vessel, such as tugboats, fishing boats, and leisure boats.Seong Ki-joo, Chief Superintendent of the Buan Coast Guard, said, "Most of the marine accidents that occur in agricultural aircraft are man-made accidents caused by insensitivity to safety. When thick fog is predicted, the safety awareness of operators, such as refraining from sailing, is more important than anything else." "We plan to further strengthen preemptive patrols and various marine accident prevention activities targeting vulnerable sea areas," he said."During the agricultural season, vessel activity increases and visibility is not secured due to thick fog, which increases the probability of marine accidents," he said. " was added.On the other hand, every spring(March-July), warm air from the southwest and relatively cool sea level meet to create dense fog(dense fog), which is called the agricultural season.

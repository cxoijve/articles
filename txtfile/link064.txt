Trump Tweets 'Thoughts And Prayers' To Victims Of US Navy Collision

U.S. President Donald Trump has tweeted his "thoughts and prayers" to the sailors aboard a U.S. destroyer that collided with a tanker near Singapore on Monday.

The incident left at least 10 sailors missing and five others injured.

The U.S. Navy said search and rescue efforts were underway in coordination with local authorities.

The USS John S. McCain had been heading to Singapore on a routine port visit.

There was no immediate explanation for the collision and the Navy said an investigation would be conducted.

It's the second accident involving a ship from the Navy's 7th Fleet in the Pacific in two months - in June, the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided in waters off Japan, leaving seven sailors dead.

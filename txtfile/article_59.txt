In particular, as it is predicted that up to 30cm or more of snow will fall on the west coast until the 21st, people are asked to refrain from going to seaside rocks, breakwaters, or coastal areas with a high risk of slipping accidents, such as ports and ports. In addition, fishermen and other vessel personnel were urged to regularly check mooring conditions and take special care to prevent flooding due to heavy snow. Lee Seon-mi, head of the Gunsan Coast Guard's marine safety division, said, "Due to heavy snowfall, ports, ports and breakwater structures often freeze, which can lead to fatal accidents such as slipping and falling into the sea while walking with hands in pockets, so special caution is needed." He said. He added, "As part of measures to prevent safety accidents in coastal waters during the winter, we have issued the 'attention' level of the winter coastal safety accident risk forecast system until January 20th of next year and are providing marine weather and safety information using police box electronic displays and broadcasting devices."In addition, "We will further strengthen patrols in dangerous areas and access control areas such as seashore rocks and breakwater structures to prevent falls in advance, check the safety status of ships moored in ports and ports, whether there is a risk of flooding or sinking, and whether slipways and slides are maintained." He emphasized, "We will make every effort to carry out prevention-oriented security activities for mooring facilities with a high risk of accidents."Meanwhile, the Gunsan Coast Guard responds to various situations by paying close attention to weather conditions and frequently checking the operational status of radar, major equipment, safety facilities within the jurisdiction, rescue boats, and scuba equipment in preparation for emergency dispatch.

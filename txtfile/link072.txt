PHILIPPINES FERRY COLLISION OIL SPILL

A Filipino father and his child walk past a bunker oil fuel slick believed to have come from the sunken ferry, MV ST Thomas Aquinas, after it was washed ashore along the mangroves of Cordova town, Mactan Island, Cebu province, central Philippines, 19 August 2013. Emergency workers were trying to contain an oil spill from the sunken ferry using chemical dispersants because the sea was too choppy to install booms. Rescuers prepared to dive in rough seas in the central Philippines to search for more than 80 people missing and feared trapped in the sunken ferry, the coast guard said. Bad weather brought on by a tropical depression has been hampering the search operations in Cebu province, 580 kilometres south of Manila, where the MV ST Thomas Aquinas sank 16 August after colliding with a cargo ship. The confirmed death toll rose to 34 after two more bodies were recovered from the sea, according to the provincial disaster management office. The ST Thomas was carrying more than 800 people when it collided with the cargo ship MV Sulpicio Express 7, whose 38 crew members were unharmed.

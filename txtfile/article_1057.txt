7 sailors missing after USS Fitzgerald collides with merchant ship off Japan.  A U.S. warship has suffered a collision at sea. The guided missile cruiser -- the USS Fitzgerald -- collided with a container ship about 80 kilometers southeast of a major U.S. naval base in Japan.   Seven U.S. sailors are missing, while another four injured sailors were airlifted from the ship by helicopter. The U.S. and Japan are searching nearby waters for the missing sailors. Three compartments on the Fitzgerald flooded, but the U.S. Navy says the ship -- despite being damaged -- is NOT in danger of sinking. It's still unclear what caused the accident.

Accordingly, the coastal rescue boat of the Gampo Police Station arrived at the scene and upon checking, found three fishermen stranded on the seashore wearing life jackets. Fortunately, there was no safety issue and the rubber boat stopped at a nearby fishing buoy.It was difficult for the rescue boat to get close to the fishing grounds, so two rescuers rescued it and boarded it in a rubber boat.There was no problem with the operation of the rubber boat, so the rescue team steered it to the seaside rocks and handed the rubber boat to the fisherman. They safely entered a nearby port under the safety management of a coastal rescue boat.Chief Kim Ji-han said, “Sometimes it happens that while fishing on a seaside rock that is not connected to the land, the line loosens and the leisure equipment is lost. If the weather is bad, it can be a very dangerous situation, so please be especially careful.”

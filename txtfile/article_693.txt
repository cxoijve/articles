A new Marine Corps brigade was launched Tuesday to undertake a mission to defend the southern resort island of Jeju and its adjacent area, the Marine Corps said.The new 9th Brigade will take over the mission to secure the safety of the southern island area from the Navy-led Jeju Defense Command, which was recently decommissioned in a reshuffle.The Navy established the new Jeju Naval Base Squadron in lieu of the dissolved command to take charge of a naval base which will be launched early next year along the southern coast of the resort island.The 500-strong Marine Corps brigade includes an emergency response battalion tasked with defense against enemy infiltration or terrorist attacks, as well as other disaster situations, according to the Marine Corps.The battalion will also be in charge of protecting airport and harbor facilities on Jeju and its surrounding area, it also added.With its recent acquisition of a decontamination vehicle, the 9th Brigade also plans to operate a special response team against potential chemical, biological and radiological attacks.About 500 military and government officials, including Lt. Gen. Lee Sang-hoon, the chief commander of the Marine Corps, were present at the ceremony to mark the establishment of the new unit on Jeju Island, according to the Marine Corps. (Yonhap)

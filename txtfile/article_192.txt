Pohang Coast Guard resolves residents' anxiety through quick inspection of Gyeongju earthquake.Pohang Marine Police Station (Chief Seong Dae-hoon) conducted a joint on-site inspection of the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant with the 2nd Brigade Commander of the 1st Marine Division (Brigade Commander Jeong Byeong-ho) in relation to the magnitude 4.0 earthquake that occurred about 19km southeast of Gyeongju-si in the early morning of the 30th.The joint inspection on this day was carried out to instill faith that there is no need to worry about maritime safety (disaster response) despite any difficulties by showing the quick joint efforts of both organizations to local residents who may be suffering from vague anxiety even though it is the safest place.Jeong Byeong-ho, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Division of the Marine Corps, said, “This joint inspection served as an opportunity to look at the land from the sea and re-examine vulnerable coastal areas, such as blind spots at Marine Corps posts, and cooperation between the two organizations is more important than anything else for the safety of the people.” Meanwhile, the Pohang Coast Guard plans to continue to inspect tsunami-vulnerable areas together with the police station to prevent additional damage from aftershocks.Chief Seong Dae-hoon said, “If there is an inland earthquake of 4.0 or higher or an offshore earthquake of 4.5 or higher, an emergency disaster text message will be sent across the country wherever the occurrence occurred. At this time, please check the disaster text message and evacuate quickly. The Coast Guard and Marine Corps will engage in immediate response activities in the event of an earthquake.” He said.Meanwhile, the Pohang Coast Guard plans to conduct the 4th joint basic water disaster preparedness training on December 6th with the theme of tsunami response.

SEOUL -- Due to misjudgment by its intoxicated skipper, a Russian cargo ship was found to have crashed into a landmark suspension bridge last month in the southern port city of Busan. The crash injured three sailors and caused structural damage to the bridge.

South Korea's coast guard said Tuesday that the 5,998-ton Seagrand had butted three moored yachts before running into the side of Diamond Bridge, which is 7.4 kilometers (4.6 miles) long, on February 28. The collision left a hole, prompting city authorities to check what the bridge should be repaired.

Based on the ship's security camera footages and voyage data recorder, the coast guard blamed misjudgment made under influence of alcohol. The Russian captain has been arrested because his blood alcohol content was well above the legal limit.

Coast guard inspectors dismissed the captain's claim that he drank cognac after he drove his ship into the bridge. He was found to have made a mistake in steering under the influence of alcohol and lost control in a chaotic situation in the ship's helm while trying to make a big turn at a high speed.

The captain was accused of ignoring a warning from the ship's chief mate that the ship was sailing on a collision course. He allegedly had tried to cover up the incident by ordering his crew to keep mum.

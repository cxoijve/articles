Freight ship fares are soaring as the U.S. and Yemeni Houthi rebels' fighting in the Red Sea has reached a strong-to-strong structure. It has already risen to the level of 40% of shipping fares, which peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tesla even announced the suspension of operations at its German plant due to disruptions in parts procurement. On the 13th (local time), the U.S. attacked the Houthi rebels' radar facility in Yemen, raising the crisis.

The Red Sea is an elongated sea with Saudi Arabia and Egypt in the east and west directions, respectively. Freight ships from East Asia, including Busan, enter the Bab al-Mandab Strait in the south of the Red Sea, pass through the Suez Canal in the north, and move to the Mediterranean Sea in the south of Europe. Ten percent of the world's maritime container logistics pass through the sea. The amount amounts to 130 trillion won (130 billion U.S. dollars). However, the situation turned sour when the Houthi rebels attacked a merchant ship (商船) passing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait since November last year. It was retaliation against Israel's invasion of Gaza.

Global shipping companies have diverted East Asia-Europe routes to the southernmost tip of the African continent to avoid threats. As the shortcut is abandoned, it takes 7 to 10 more days to operate. The longer the ship comes and goes, the more cargoes wait to wait for the next ship. It is the same as the principle that passengers become crowded if the train runs longer at a subway station. It is natural that the shipper who has to send the goods even by paying extra money comes out, and the fare goes up accordingly.

container fares have tripled from a year ago

Sea fares on Asia-Europe routes are $3103 per 1 TEU (one 20-foot container with a long side length). This is an 8.1 percent increase from a week ago ($2871). Compared to a year ago ($1050), it nearly tripled. In the first quarter of 2022, when sea fares were at their peak due to COVID-19, the average fare was $7435. This is why some in the shipping industry even say, "The second COVID-19 fare may be reproduced" over the recent surge in fares.

Shipping companies are the only ones laughing at rising freight rates. Shippers are concerned about cost burden, and the government is concerned whether it will lead to rising consumer prices. The government recently held a meeting of relevant government ministries and announced measures to secure cargo-only loading space for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). HMM, Korea's largest shipping company, has decided to deploy four ships taking different routes to Europe by next month. Europe is facing difficulties not only in rising costs but also in procuring goods. Tesla, which procures key parts from China, suspended production at its German plant until Nov. 11. Volvo Cars also decided to halt production at its plants in Belgium for three days during the third week of January.

"We need to prepare for the plunge in prices from now on."

The drought on the Panama Canal, which mainly passes through the eastern U.S. to Asian routes, is also fueling freight rates to rise. This is because the water level of the canal has been lowered, limiting the passage of cargo ships. Some predict that freight rates will rise until at least May this year if the fighting situation in the Red Sea is not resolved. This is because the water level of the canal is difficult to recover before May, the rainy season in Panama. Normalization of Panama routes → introduction of spare ships to East Asia-Europe routes → Suppression of soaring freight rates is a scenario in which the worst is avoided. "Price distortion caused by external factors such as war and drought could bring another risk of a sharp drop in prices when this factor disappears, so preparations are also needed," said Lee Seok-yong, head of the Smart Shipping Information Center of the Korea Maritime Development Corporation.

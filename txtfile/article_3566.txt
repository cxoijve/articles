Fighting MisinformationOn June 15, at the annex of the Seoul Government Complex, Korean government officials answer questions from reporters at a briefing on the discharge of contaminated water from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan.Growing public anxiety over the recent release of contaminated water from Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan has prompted the Korean government to hold daily briefings on the issue to actively deal with fake news and fear mongering.The Korean government will crack down on those who make and distribute such fake news, said Park Koo-yeon, an official of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, at a daily briefing on the release of contaminated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the Korean Government Complex in Seoul on June 15. It plans to hold daily briefings on the contaminated water at 11 a.m. every day, except holidays, from June 15 onward. In addition to Park, Vice Minister of Oceans and Fisheries Song Sang-keun and civilian expert Heo Kyun-young, a professor of nuclear engineering at Kyung Hee University, will attend the daily briefing.“There are growing public and media concerns about Japan’s planned discharge of the contaminated water from the nuclear power plant into the ocean,” Park said, “We should not allow concerns to grow due to a lack of information or the spread of misinformation.”“We are comprehensively analyzing Japan’s contaminated water management situation from a scientific and technical point of view based on data obtained during a visit to the site in question in May,” Park said. “In particular, we are studying the performances of the Advanced Liquid Processing System in Japan and the reliability of data released by the Japanese government, and we will inform you of the results of our study as soon as it is completed.”“We have selected 92 representative spots in domestic waters and are carefully monitoring whether radioactive substances entered the spots and areas around them by collecting and examining seawater, seabed sediments, and marine life,” Song said. “As a result of our radiation monitoring conducted so far, the radiation concentration in domestic coastal waters remains at a level similar to that before the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, which is about one several thousandth to one hundred thousandth of those set by internationally accepted safety standards.”“Currently, the Korean government conducts radiation tests on Korean seafood at both the production stage and the distribution stage,” Song said. “For the production stage tests, the results of all 29,667 radiation tests since the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 have shown that Korean seafood is edible. At the distribution stage as well, 45,948 tests have been conducted on Korean seafood to date. All of the distribution stage results have also shown that Korean seafood is fit to put to table.”As for a special law on the contaminated water recently proposed at the National Assembly, Song called it “premature.” On June 12, 73 lawmakers from the opposition Democratic Party of Korea and others proposed a special law aimed at supporting fishermen affected by the discharge of the contaminated water and declaring the affected areas as special disaster areas. “It is too early to discuss compensation for and recovery from damage that has not even happened yet,” Song said.The National Federation Of Fisheries Cooperatives of Korea is also speeding up its responses to the contaminated water. The organization, along with the Korea Federation of Fishery Businesses and the Customers Union of Korea, organized a campaign headquarters to protect Korean seafood and issued a public appeal. “The value of one million Korean fishermen is at risk of collapsing due to the discharge of polluted water in Japan,” the headquarters said, “We will resolutely deal with any unfounded anxiety and fear causing the consumption of seafood to decline.”Jung Min-heepr@businesskorea.co.krView More ArticleCopyright © BusinessKorea.

The government announced plans Friday to form an examination team including civilian experts to carry out a comprehensive safety examination of all 21 nuclear power plants currently operating in South Korea, and to consider halting their operation if a precise diagnosis is required.Civic groups responded by arguing that the team should also include resident representatives and National Assembly lawmakers.In a report Friday to President Lee Myung-bak on its plans for domestic nuclear power plant safety examinations, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) said, “We plan to take the nuclear power accidents in Japan as an occasion for forming a joint government-civilian examination team including a variety of experts and carrying out a comprehensive examination of domestic nuclear power plant safety.”The ministry said it also plans to focus its examination on the safety of nine plants that have been active for more than twenty years, including the Gori No. 1 reactor and Wolseong No. 1 reactor, and consider suspending operations at any plants requiring a precise diagnosis.The methods of selection for the team and the specific plans for examination are to be decided at a meeting of the Reactor Safety Commission taking place at the ministry at 4 p.m. on Mar. 21. This committee is chaired by Minister of Education, Science and Technology Lee Ju-ho and includes seven civilian experts, including KAIST Professor of Nuclear and Quantum Engineering Chang Sun-heung.Kim Young-sik, head of the MEST’s Office of R&D Policy, said this marks the first time the safety of all 21 plants is to be examined at one time.“A number of response measures will be established that were not included in previous accident response procedure, including measures for when the water in the spent fuel pool has run out,” Kim explained.MEST also announced plans to increase the number of radiation monitoring sites as a precautionary measure for nuclear power plant accidents in surrounding countries, with priority installation of monitoring sites at Ieodo Rock off Jeju Island and at the marine science base at Gageo Reef, an underwater reef off Sinan County, South Jeolla Province. There are currently 70 radiation monitoring sites in operation.In response, the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement (KFEM) released a statement saying, “The direct risks of nuclear power plants are borne by nearby residents and citizens.”“Citizen representatives from the four nuclear power plant regions, National Assembly members, and civic group representatives should also participate on the government-civilian examination body,” the group said.Yang-Lee Won-yeong, head of the KFEM organized activity bureau, said, “Even though we are right next to Japan, it seems like our government has less of a sense of tension than those of countries on the other side of the world."“We urgently need to establish a national radiation prevention headquarters to handle examinations by medical institutions, secure medication, and provide tips for citizen actions,” Yang-Lee added.

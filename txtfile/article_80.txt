Incheon Marine Police Station announced that it will issue a ‘Attention’ safety accident risk forecast system from the 14th to the 18th. According to the Incheon Coast Guard, as the weather gets cooler, the number of tourists visiting the coast increases, and the possibility of accidents is high due to the rise in sea level, so special caution is needed.
Incheon Coast Guard is strengthening land and sea patrols according to tidal times and maintaining emergency response readiness to prepare for coastal accidents such as tidal flat isolation. An Incheon Coast Guard official said, “The West Sea has a very large tidal range and the speed at which water comes in is high, so there is a high possibility of casualties.” He added, “During coastal activities, be sure to follow marine safety rules such as not entering dangerous areas, wearing life jackets, and checking the tide. “We must do it,” he urged. Meanwhile, by downloading and using apps such as ‘Sea Navi’, ‘Harrod’, and ‘Safe Sea’, you can obtain various marine safety information such as tide tables.

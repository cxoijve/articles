Two cargo ships have collided in the North Sea off the coast of Germany, leaving one crew member dead and four missing. 
Two of the seven crew aboard the British flagged freighter, Verity, which collided with the Bahamian Polesie at around 5 AM local time on Tuesday morning, have been rescued.
According to the German Coast Guard, rescue efforts are continuing, with divers searching the sunken Verity for "signs of life."
The Verity was en route to the UK from Bremen, Germany with a cargo of steel when it collided with the Polesie, a ship that was en route from Hamburg to La Coru√±a in Spain.
None of the 22 people on board the Polesie were injured.

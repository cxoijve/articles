 Two Korean tourists are missing  after the boat they were traveling on  crashed into a large fishing vessel off Thailand's western coast.
  Local police say  the tourist speedboat was carrying a total of 42 people, including 34 tourists and three crew members, from Phi Phi island to Phuket.
Marine police were able to rescue 27 of those on board the tourist boat  while villagers on boats retrieved eight others.
An official from the Korean Embassy in Thailand identified the missing  as a 31-year-old man with the family name Ko  and a 28-year-old woman with the surname Ahn.
Police say bad weather conditions could likely have caused the collision  and they are questioning the speedboat's crew and the fishing boat's captain for further details.
